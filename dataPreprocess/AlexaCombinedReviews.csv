Love my Echo!,"

I'm so fond of my Echo!"
Loved it!,"

I adored it!"
"Sometimes while playing a game, you can answer a question correctly but Alexa says you got it wrong and answers the same as you.  I like being able to turn lights on and off while away from home.","

Sometimes when playing a game, I can answer a question correctly, but Alexa will incorrectly tell me that my answer is wrong and give the same response as me. I really enjoy the convenience of being able to control the lights in my house when I'm not there."
"I have had a lot of fun with this thing. My 4 yr old learns about dinosaurs, i control the lights and play games like categories. Has nice sound when playing music as well.","

I've had a blast with this device. My four year old has been learning a lot about dinosaurs, I can control the lighting and play games such as Categories, and it has great sound quality when playing music."
Music," is the food of the soul

Music nourishes the spirit."

I was gifted an Echo and I wanted something with Bluetooth capabilities to make playing music easier. I am excited to explore the capabilities of this smart speaker."
"Without having a cellphone, I cannot use many of her features. I have an iPad but do not see that of any use.  It IS a great alarm.  If u r almost deaf, you can hear her alarm in the bedroom from out in the living room, so that is reason enough to keep her.It is fun to ask random questions to hear her response.  She does not seem to be very smartbon politics yet.","

Without having a cellphone, I cannot take advantage of many of its functions. Although I have an iPad, I don't find it very useful. However, the phone's alarm is incredibly loud, so even if you are nearly deaf, you can easily hear it from the living room. Additionally, it's enjoyable to ask random questions and hear the phone's response. It may not be particularly knowledgeable about politics, but that's not a major issue."
I think this is the 5th one I've purchased. I'm working on getting one in every room of my house. I really like what features they offer specifily playing music on all Echos and controlling the lights throughout my house.,"

I have already bought five of these, and I am aiming to have one in every room of my house. I really appreciate the features they provide, such as playing music on all Echos and being able to control the lights in my home."
looks great,"

It appears fantastic."
"Love it! I’ve listened to songs I haven’t heard since childhood! I get the news, weather, information! It’s great!","

I am absolutely loving this! I can listen to songs I haven't heard in years! Plus, I can get the latest news, weather, and other information! It's amazing!"
"I sent it to my 85 year old Dad, and he talks to it constantly.","

I gave the present to my 85 year old father, and he has been conversing with it regularly."
I love it! Learning knew things with it eveyday! Still figuring out how everything works but so far it's been easy to use and understand. She does make me laugh at times,"

I am really enjoying discovering new things with it every day! I'm still getting the hang of how it all works, but it has been straightforward and easy to comprehend so far. She does make me chuckle occasionally."
"I purchased this for my mother who is having knee problems now, to give her something to do while trying to over come not getting around so fast like she did.She enjoys all the little and big things it can do...Alexa play this song, What time is it and where, and how to cook this and that!","

I bought this for my mom who is currently struggling with her knees and can't move around as quickly as she used to. She loves all the things it can do - from playing music to telling the time and location to giving instructions on how to make different dishes."
"Love, Love, Love!!","

Oh, how I adore it!"
Just what I expected....,"

It was precisely what I anticipated."

Really happy with this purchase.  Great speaker and easy to set up.,"

I am ecstatic about this acquisition. The speaker is outstanding and setting it up was a breeze."
We have only been using Alexa for a couple of days and are having a lot of fun with our new toy. It like having a new household member! We are trying to learn all the different featues and benefits that come with it.,"

We've just had Alexa for a few days and are already having a blast with our new gadget. It's almost like having a new family member! We're still discovering all the cool features and advantages that come with it."
We love the size of the 2nd generation echo. Still needs a little improvement on sound,"

We adore the dimensions of the 2nd generation echo. It could still use some refinement in terms of sound."
"I liked the original Echo. This is the same but shorter and with greater fabric/color choices. I miss the volume ring on top, now it's just the plus/minus buttons. Not a big deal but the ring w as comforting. :) Other than that, well I do like the use of a standard USB charger /port instead of the previous round pin. Other than that, I guess it sounds the same, seems to work the same, still answers to Alexa/Echo/Computer. So what's not to like? :)","

I enjoyed the original Echo, but this new version is shorter and has more fabric/color options. I do miss the volume ring on top, though, as the plus/minus buttons aren't quite the same. It's not a major issue, but the ring was quite comforting. I do appreciate the use of a standard USB charger/port instead of the round pin from before. Other than that, it sounds and functions the same, responding to Alexa/Echo/Computer. All in all, there's not much to dislike about it."
Love the Echo and how good the music sounds playing off it. Alexa understands most commands but it is difficult at times for her to find specific playlists or songs on Spotify. She is good with Amazon Music but is lacking in other major programs.,"

I'm a fan of the Echo and how great the music sounds when played through it. Alexa is usually able to comprehend commands, but it can be tricky for her to locate certain playlists or tunes on Spotify. She is proficient with Amazon Music, but is not as adept with other prominent platforms."
"We love Alexa! We use her to play music, play radio through iTunes, play podcasts through Anypod, and set reminders. We listen to our flash briefing of news and weather every morning. We rely on our custom lists. We like being able to voice control the volume. We're sure we'll continue to find new uses.Sometimes it's a bit frustrating when Alexa doesn't understand what we're saying.","

We adore Alexa! We take advantage of her to play tunes, broadcast radio through iTunes, listen to podcasts with Anypod, and create reminders. We tune in to our personalized flash briefing of news and weather every morning. We depend on our custom lists. We appreciate being able to adjust the volume with our voice. We're certain we'll keep discovering new uses for her. It can be a bit annoying when Alexa doesn't comprehend what we're saying though."
"Have only had it set up for a few days. Still adding smart home devices to it. The speaker is great for playing music. I like the size, we have it stationed on the kitchen counter and it’s not intrusive to look at.","

I've only had the smart home setup for a few days and I'm still adding more devices. The speaker is great for playing music and I like the size; it fits nicely on the kitchen counter without being too much of an eyesore."
I love it. It plays my sleep sounds immediately when I ask,"

I am thrilled with it; it begins playing my sleep sounds as soon as I request it."
"I got a second unit for the bedroom, I was expecting the sounds to be improved but I didnt really see a difference at all.  Overall, not a big improvement over the 1st generation.","

I purchased an additional unit for the bedroom, yet I did not notice any significant changes in sound quality. All in all, the second unit did not make a great improvement compared to the first one."
Amazing product,"

Incredible item"

Sounds great!! Love them!,"

That's fantastic! I am really fond of them."
"Fun item to play with and get used to using.  Sometimes has hard time answering the questions you ask, but I think it will be better.","

An entertaining object to become familiar with. It can have difficulty responding to inquiries at times, but I anticipate improvement."
Just like the other one,"

Similarly to the other one"
Still learning all the capabilities...but so far pretty pretty pretty good,"

I'm still discovering all the features...but so far I'm really enjoying it."
I like it,"

I'm fond of it"
"She works well. Needs a learning command  for unique, owners and users like. Alexa “learn” Tasha’s birthday.  Or Alexa “learn” my definition of Fine. Etc. other than that she is great","

She works really well and is great overall, but she could benefit from being able to learn commands like ""Alexa, learn Tasha's birthday"" or ""Alexa, learn my definition of Fine"", etc. for unique owners and users."
The speakers sound pretty good for being so small and setup is pretty easy.  I bought two and the reason I only rate it a 3 is I have followed the instructions for synching music to both units.  I know I've done it correctly but they won't sync.  That was my primary motivation for purchasing multiple units.,"

The speakers are quite impressive for their size and setting them up was straightforward. I got two of them, but I'm only giving them three stars because I can't seem to get them to sync music together, even though I've followed the instructions correctly. That was the main reason why I bought two."
This device is awesome!,"

This device is incredible!"
I bought this to compare the speaker quality to our first generation speaker and i like the sound better.  I will ship this to my daughter though because I like the fact that my first generation has a chargeable base that we bought which keeps it more mobile and she needs a better sound than what she has now.,"

I purchased this to evaluate the sound quality against our previous model speaker, and I prefer the sound of this one. However, I will be sending it to my daughter, as I appreciate the convenience of the rechargeable base of our original speaker, which allows for more portability, and she requires an improved sound than what she presently has."
"Love my Echo. Still learning all the things it will do. Wasn’t able to follow instructions included in the package, but found a great one on U-Tube.","

I am so fond of my Echo. I am still discovering all the things it is capable of doing. I wasn't able to understand the instructions that came with it, but I found a helpful tutorial on YouTube."
Speaker is better than 1st generation Echo,"

The sound quality of the Speaker is superior to that of the first generation Amazon Echo."
"This thing is way cool!  You should get one.  If you want to be cool, that is.","

This item is incredibly awesome! If you want to look stylish, you should definitely get one."
"This is my first digital assistant so I'm giving this a good review. Speaker is really good for the cheap price on Prime day. Fun to play with and can be used as an alarm clock (That's what I was going to get in the first place, but I ended up with Echo). If you haven't had a go with one then definitely try it!What I like best is the number of other devices that it can connect with. My purchase came with a Smart Plug for $10 which I connect my lamp to. Alexa, turn of the lights!","

I'm really pleased with my first digital assistant, especially since I got it on Prime day at an affordable price. It's great fun to use and can also be used as an alarm clock, which is what I originally wanted. I'd highly recommend giving one a try if you haven't already. The best part is that it can be connected with a variety of other devices, and I even got a Smart Plug for only $10 with my purchase. Now I can just say ""Alexa, turn off the lights!"""
My husband likes being able to use it to listen to music.  I wish we knew all it's capabilities,"

I wish we were aware of all the features my husband enjoys utilizing to listen to music."
"My Android would not allow Alexa to connect. Fortunately, my sister was here with her Apple cell. After an hour+ tech support fixed the glitches. We are up and running.","

My Android wasn't working with Alexa, but luckily my sister had her Apple phone. After spending more than an hour with tech support, we managed to get the problem sorted out and now everything is working properly."

Very satisfied with the Echo. Alexa now controls the lights in my family room and my wife can listen to Jimmy Buffet by just asking Alexa.,"

I am extremely pleased with the Echo. Alexa is now able to switch on the lights in my family room, and my wife can easily request for Jimmy Buffet songs with a simple command."
"It's like Siri, in fact, Siri answers more accurately then Alexa.  I don't see a real need for it in my household, though it was a good bargain on prime day deals.","

It's similar to Siri, in fact, Siri is more precise with its answers than Alexa. I don't think I need it in my home, even though it was a great deal during Prime Day."
Love my Echo. Still learning how every thing works but having tons of fun.,"

I'm really enjoying my Echo. I'm still figuring out how all the features work, but it's been a great experience."
I love you so much,"

I have tremendous affection for you."
No different than Apple. To play a specific list of music you must have an Amazon of Spotify “plus/prime/etc” account.  So you must pay to play “your” music.  3 stars for that reason.  Everything else is 👍🏻 .,"

It is the same as Apple in that you need a paid Amazon or Spotify account to access your music. This is why it only gets three stars. All other features are great."
"Excelente, lo unico es que no esta en español.","

Fantastic, the only thing is that it is not in Spanish."

Does everything as expected and more.,"

It exceeds all expectations."
"I love my Echo!  Works just like they said it would. I don't have a &#34;smart&#34; home, so I cannot speak about that function, but everything else about it is good.","

"I bought this because it can control fios television. It works well. I’m hoping over time it will do more to control fios. Then I discovered all the other things Alexa can do. Play music you ask for. Great sound from Alexa. Play games. Play radio stations. Play old time radio programs like the Long Ranger. Alexa has many “apps” you can add to her abilities. The other day I played Madlibs. Great fun. Also Alexa can control household appliances. I just purchased Alexa compatible power strips to control lighting, fans and TV components. I’m looking forward to implementing this controll. You can also add other Alexa components to have chosen music to play in all rooms where the components are located.","

I bought this product because it can control my Fios TV, and it works great. I'm hopeful that it will be able to do more with Fios in the future. Then I found out that Alexa could do so much more, like playing music I request, providing great sound quality, playing games, radio stations, and old-time radio shows like The Lone Ranger. Plus, there are many ""apps"" you can add to its capabilities. Recently, I played Madlibs with Alexa, which was a lot of fun. Additionally, Alexa can control household appliances, so I just bought some Alexa compatible power strips to control lighting, fans, and TV components. I'm really looking forward to using this control. You can also add other Alexa components so that you can have chosen music playing in all rooms with the components."

I was a little nervous when I received my new Echo as I'm not really Tech savvy. I found it a bit intimidating at first but it didn't take me to long to figure it out!! I'm very happy with my purchase and now thinking of adding an echo spot!!!,"

When I got my new Echo, I was a bit anxious because I'm not the best with technology. Initially, I was a bit overwhelmed, but I was able to figure it out fairly quickly. I'm really pleased with my purchase and I'm now considering buying an Echo Spot!"

The echo works well. I was able to sync it with my other Amazon music devices.,"

I had no trouble getting the echo to work properly, and I was able to easily connect it with my other Amazon music devices."
"Works great, but I don't think Amazon should charge another cent for unlimited music when you 1) Have Prime AND 2) Buy an Echo.","

I believe Amazon should not charge any additional cost for unlimited music if a customer has a Prime membership and also purchases an Echo. It works well, so no extra charge should be applied."
Already had an Echo Dot. The Echo is even better with fuller sound. Also during setup it now lets phone calls to be made to my contact list which is great!,"

"Love it! I was thinking about getting one and when the prime day discount was offered, I could not pass it up! It's fun to ask Alexa to play any song or group and she comes up with a playlist from Amazon Prime Music. You can also connect your iPhone with bluetooth and play music with Pandora or YouTube videos using Alexa as a speaker. I've been having fun asking Alexa different types of questions or for information like weather, news or even the time in other countries. The only downside is if you have limited data on your wifi plan, because Alexa uses burns it up when playing music.","

I was so excited when I saw the Prime Day discount and decided to buy one. It's been really fun using Alexa to play songs, groups, and even Pandora or YouTube videos. It's also super useful to ask her questions like what the weather is like, the news, or the time in other countries. The only downside is that Alexa uses a lot of data when playing music, so if you have a limited data plan, it might be something to think about."
"We like it all so far, but have a lot to try out yet.","

So far we're really enjoying it, however we still have a lot to explore."

I'm a big fan of the Echo! I'm really impressed with its size, construction, and sound quality. It was easy to connect it to one light, and I'm planning to link more lights and a thermostat to it too. I'm also considering getting an Echo Dot for my bedroom. There are so many things you can do with the Echo - traffic updates, weather forecasts, trivia games, and more."

I'm truly astonished at the sound quality when listening to music from this device. The bass is incredibly full and rich, almost as if it were coming from a larger speaker. Kudos to Amazon for this incredible product!"
"It’s still a great product.But the sound quality does seem worse.Don’t get me wrong. You definitely get used to it within an hour. But it definitely feels like echo gen 1 sound quality was better.Besides that , it’s great.With the addition of being able to play Just over Bluetooth with no WiFi, it’s even better.","

Despite the fact that the sound quality does seem to be worse, the product is still great. I'm not trying to suggest otherwise. You do get used to it after an hour, but it does feel like the sound quality of Echo Gen 1 was better. Nevertheless, the product is still good, especially since you can now play it over Bluetooth without needing WiFi."
The outlet does not work with it. Was disappointed in that.,"

I was disappointed that the outlet did not function properly."
"Great device, responsive and helpful","

Sound is terrible if u want good music too get a bose,"

If you want good quality music, you should invest in a Bose system, as sound quality can be terrible otherwise."
"i liked the sound . what is troubling is that I paid extra money to have access to a million more songs. Sometimes it doesn't work. Ex. Alexa play Italian songs&#34; .don't have or don&#34; t understand. or play the opera Tosca, response &#34;sorry I don&#34;t have that.","

I enjoyed the sound I was getting, however, I was disappointed that I had to pay extra money for access to a million more songs, yet sometimes it doesn't even work. For example, when I asked Alexa to play Italian songs, she didn't have any or understand my request, and when I asked her to play the opera Tosca, she said sorry she didn't have that."
Easy to set up and use. Too bad it has to be plugged in. Would be nice to take it outside and operate on battery and recharged.,"

It's convenient to install and use, however it needs to be plugged in. It would be great if it was possible to use it outside with a battery that could be recharged."
Still learning all the ways to use it.  It is a real hit with my grandkids who ask it to play music and then dance to it.  (5 and 7 yrs).  Very cute.,"

I'm still figuring out all the different things I can do with it. My grandchildren, who are five and seven years old, absolutely love it - they'll ask it to play music and then they'll start dancing! It's so adorable."
"4.5 out of 5 Stars. I generally like this product. Its great at doing what you ask of it like playing music, setting timers, and making calls. Reason why I didn't rate it 5 out of 5 is that sometimes the connection dies and my Echo stops playing music and shows a red ring. Seems to be a connection issue. Overall, great product.","

I generally have a positive opinion of this product. It does what it is supposed to do very well, such as playing music, setting timers, and making calls. The only downside is that sometimes the connection drops and the Echo stops working and displays a red ring. Despite this, I still think it is a great product."

Very cool product. Speaker sounds good with my Spotify blasting through it.,"

This product is really awesome! The speaker produces excellent sound quality while playing my Spotify tunes."
Having so much fun with Alexa. Love being able to listen to music when I’m across the room or busy doing something else.,"

I am having a blast using Alexa. It is great to be able to play music from a distance or while I am occupied with something else."
"So far it seems to be a very nice item. It picks up on my voice and understands me without any problems. The other day I asked it to turn down the music from the next room and it heard me just fine. I've only used it to listen to music and check the weather, but it has done both of those things very well.","

It appears to be a great item thus far. It has been able to detect my voice with ease and comprehend what I am saying. Recently, I requested it to reduce the volume of the music from the other room and it heard me clearly. I have only used it to listen to music and get the weather, and it has done a great job with both."
Love our echo,"

Adore our reverberation"
"I love it,she is very helpful. I use her for remembering things and sleep. You can ask her just about anything. I have only had her for about a week so still learning her.","

I'm really fond of her because she's so useful. I rely on her for memorizing tasks and getting a good night's rest. She's quite knowledgeable and I've only had her for about a week, so I'm still getting used to her."
"It's better than the 1st gen in every way except for one.  I really miss the ring at the top for volume control.  It was quicker and easier to just grab the top and twist without having to look at the buttons and find the &#34;-&#34; one and press it a few times.  I also wish the bass was a bit better.  All in all, it's a great device and I'm happy with it.","

This device is an upgrade from the 1st generation in almost every way, but I do miss the ring at the top for volume control. It was so much quicker and easier to just twist the ring without having to search for the volume buttons. Additionally, I wish the bass was a bit stronger. Despite this, I'm still pleased with the device overall."
I love having an Alexa!,"

I am fond of my Alexa!"
So far I like it 🤓,"

I am thoroughly enjoying my Ecoo!  Love to have it read my audiobook to me while in the office and then I can simply open the audiobook on my kindle to continue it when elsewhere. Wonderful for listening to music when not in the mood for a book. Great for setting reminders for myself too and so much more.,"

I'm really enjoying my Ecoo! It's great to have it read my audiobooks to me while I'm at work, and then I can just pick up the audiobook on my Kindle when I'm out and about. It's also great for listening to music when I don't feel like reading, and it's been really helpful for setting reminders for myself. It can do so much more too."

I recently installed a full house sound system that streams Sirius, and it does a great job of providing background music for activities like listening to talk radio in the morning and turning lights on and off."
"I have had for only a week, so I am still learning all that Alexa can do.  It is a learning process.  I love the music I can call up any time.  I listen to podcasts and radio stations.  I have just started keeping shopping lists and grocery lists, which I love.  I don’t have to search for paper and pencil.  Getting time and temperature are great, do not have to wait for weather reports.  The sound is good.  I am not fussy about woofers, tweeters, base , etc.  the Echo is fine for me.  This afternoon I am going to try “dropping in”.on my son when he gets home.  Going to surprise him.","

I've had my Alexa for only a week, so I'm still learning all the things it can do. It's been a great experience so far, and I'm really enjoying the music I can access at any time. I'm also listening to podcasts and radio stations, and I just started using it to make shopping and grocery lists, which is really handy since I don't have to search for a pen and paper. I also love that I can ask it for the time and temperature without having to wait for a weather report. The sound quality is good, and I'm not too picky about woofers, tweeters, and base, so the Echo is perfect for me. This afternoon, I'm going to try ""dropping in"" on my son when he gets home - it'll be a nice surprise."

Everyone should have an Echo or two or three or more. I bought my Echo through QVC.,"

I purchased my Echo device from QVC, and I think everyone should own at least a couple of them."
it's annoying that everything they show Alexa as being able to do has to be downloaded. You spend so  much time trying to figure out how to phrase it for the machine that you may as well just look it up yourself,"

It is frustrating that in order to access all of Alexa's capabilities, you have to download them. It takes so much effort to figure out the right way to phrase your request that it would be simpler to just look up the information yourself."
I have had Alexa since the beginning.  I accidentally spilled water on her and have replaced it with the 2nd generation.  I decided I couldn't be without an Echo.  Setup was easy and had it working within minutes.,"

I first got an Alexa at the start, but unfortunately spilled water on it, so I had to get the 2nd generation. I couldn't bear to be without an Echo, so setup was a breeze and I had it up and running in no time."
"I like being able to tell Alexia the music I want to hear, but sometimes she has trouble finding the song if I am not very specific about the title.","

I enjoy informing Alexia of the music I want to listen to, however, she occasionally has difficulty locating the tune if I am not precise regarding the name."
I like the looks better than the original echo.  I moved my old echo to the basement family room. Nice sound.,"

I prefer the aesthetics of the new echo more than the original one, so I relocated my old echo to the basement family room. The sound quality is great."
The Echo is wonderful but I'm still learning how to use it. Music requests are somewhat limited.,"

I'm still getting to grips with the Echo but it's great. The music selection is a bit restricted though."
"Doesn't know half the things asked. Can't recognize my sprinkler wifi controller, even though product details says it is compatible. Can't program or change my wifi thermostat settings and its matched up on same wifi router. Just a handy music player. That's if you have Amazon Music.","

They don't know much of what is being asked, and they can't seem to recognize their sprinkler wifi controller even though the product details say it is compatible. They also can't program or change the settings for their wifi thermostat, even though it is connected to the same wifi router. The only thing they are good at is playing music, but only if they have Amazon Music."

We were pleasantly surprised at the sound quality and the many features. How nice to easily hear a particular artist or hear our books just by a simple command. Looking forward to exploring other options with this device.,"

We were delighted with the audio quality and the abundance of features. It was fantastic to be able to quickly locate a certain musician or listen to our audiobooks with a mere command. We are eager to explore the other possibilities this device has to offer."
Met and exceeded my expectations. Easy set up and is really quick in responses.,"

I was pleasantly surprised by the results; the setup process was a breeze and the reaction time was incredibly fast."
"I like the fact that I can get any kind of music from Prime that I want on request from Alexa. I liked the informative photo little pamphlet but wish it included how to connect your TV etc. to the commands from Alexa. BUT, I really love having the music.","

I'm really thrilled by the fact that I can request any kind of music I want from Prime through Alexa. While the informative pamphlet was great, I wish it had included instructions on how to connect your TV to Alexa. Nevertheless, I'm ecstatic to have access to the music."
"i have not found a way to access my echo thorough my prime account.  I think it should be part of the top line with video, music, etc.  I also think the setup app where i define, for example music i like, is not well integrated into echo.  I have tried to ask for my playlist and echo is not sure even though i set up play list in my settings.  I also do not like the fact that my words have to be exact match of my playlist names, which i can never remember.I like the ready nature of echo to respond to most any queries.","

I have been unable to locate a way to link my Echo device to my Prime account. It should be part of the main menu with other features such as video and music. Additionally, I have found that the setup app which allows me to define my preferences, like my favorite music, is not well integrated with Echo. Whenever I try to ask for my playlist, Echo seems uncertain, even though I have already set it up in my settings. I also do not appreciate the fact that I have to use the exact name of my playlist, which I often cannot recall. On the other hand, I do appreciate the readiness of Echo to respond to most of my queries."
This is great item and just added audible books which makes it even better. Thank you!,"

This is an excellent product and they just added audible books, making it even more impressive. Appreciate it!"
"During Prime Day this 2nd gen Echo was on sale so I couldn't resist! This was the beginning to my smart home set up and I couldn't be happier to say that Alexa has done an amazing job connecting to all of my ""smart"" devices. Thanks to her, I can control my lights, smart plugs, TV, etc. I had no trouble connecting the Echo to my WiFi and my phone. The app works perfectly fine and it let's you add skills, routines, smart devices, timers, and so much more! Sound quality is good enough for me, since I am not an audiophile. Alexa can hear my voice even when watching movies at a high volume. Design is great and modern, it will definitely add a nice touch to your home and you can change the covers if you'd like as there are more for sale. Overall, this is a great addition to my home and enables so many possibilities. If you haven't yet, be sure to add Alexa to your home!","

I decided to purchase the 2nd generation Echo during Prime Day and I couldn't be happier with my decision. It was really easy to set up the Echo with my Wi-Fi and phone and the app works perfectly. I'm able to control my lights, smart plugs, TV, and more with Alexa and the sound quality is good enough for me. I also like the modern design of the Echo and you can change the covers if you want. I'm very pleased with this purchase and it has enabled so many possibilities. If you haven't already, I highly recommend adding Alexa to your home!"

"It performs pretty much as expected, but I am very disappointed it will not provide me with the terminology I need to play various kinds of music without subscribing to the Amazon music service.  I understand my music choices may be limited, but without knowing HOW TO ASK, I cannot access the music that is provided free along with my Echo purchase.  Do you have a chart showing the language I need to use?","

I am let down that my Echo will not give me the words I need to play different kinds of music without signing up for Amazon Music. I understand my music choices may be restricted, but I cannot access the music that comes with my Echo purchase if I don't know the right way to ask. Is there a chart that displays the language I need to use?"

I received this as a present and I'm really enjoying it. I probably wouldn't have purchased it for myself, but now that I have it I can use it to play music from my Amazon Prime Music, which is worth it on its own. Additionally, it provides news updates and tells jokes."

"My mom bought a few Echo Dots and repeated ask me to take one of hers because it was so great. I told her “no” for two days. When she made me take it, 6 hours later I could not live my life without it!  It’s that amazing, so now we have four large speakers and only the small Echo Dot, that I will be returning to her. I say if you’re going to order an Alexa speaker, go big and get the Echo, otherwise tou’ll Be returning the two Echo Dots you couldn’t live without.","

My mom purchased a couple of Echo Dots and kept telling me to grab one of hers because it was amazing. I refused for two days. After she made me take it, I couldn't imagine my life without it in just 6 hours! It's that incredible, so now we have four huge speakers and the only small Echo Dot is the one I will be returning to her. I suggest if you're planning to buy an Alexa speaker, go all out and get the Echo, or else you'll be giving back the two Echo Dots that you couldn't do without."
Love it!! Great product!!!,"

I am really enjoying this item! It is fantastic!"

"Really disappointed Alexa has to be plug-in to wall socket all the time.  My fault for not checking this, but made the assumption that a company has technologically advanced as Amazon would sell this product with a rechargeable battery.  If I could return it, I would as my Apple music and boom speaker give me more flexibility the Alexa.","

I'm so let down that Alexa needs to be plugged in to a wall socket all the time. It's my own fault for not verifying this before purchasing, but I assumed that a company as advanced as Amazon would have sold a version of this product with a rechargeable battery. I would return it if I could, as my Apple music and boom speaker offer me more freedom than Alexa."
I don't think the &#34;2nd gen&#34; sounds as good as the 1st.  But it does have an aux out... so you could add an external speaker.  But if you are going to do that why wouldn't you just get a dot?  2nd issue is (which isn't unique to this unit but I don't understand why I can't override the default that prevents you from playing a blue tooth speaker while playing through a &#34;group&#34;.  I get there is a delay when using a BT speaker.  But if the other units are not where they can be heard then I should be able to play as a group while using the BT speaker.,"

I'm not sure the ""2nd gen"" sounds as good as the first one. However, it does have an auxiliary output, so you can connect an external speaker. But if you want to do that, you may as well just get a Dot. The other issue I don't understand is why I can't override the default setting that prevents playing a Bluetooth speaker while playing through a ""group"". I understand there is a delay when using a Bluetooth speaker, but if the other units are not in a place where they can be heard, I should be able to play as a group while using the Bluetooth speaker."

"Love my new addition to the house! Speaker quality is great and over all we love our Alexa. My only two ( not complaints, more suggestions for the future series) would be better communication ability. Example: For our smart lights in the house. Unless we specify kitchen Light 1 or kitchen Light 2 prior to the command she either won’t respond or says she doesn’t recognize. It may be me, but I want my Alexa to respond when I say thank you afterwards. I have to repeat Alexa thank you and there are times she won’t respond to me, but will my husband. I know it sounds odd. We laugh about it, but maybe it’s a Southern thing but I want my Alexa to have manners too.","

I'm really happy with my new addition to the house! The sound quality is great and we all love our Alexa. My only two suggestions for future series would be to improve communication ability. For example, when I ask her to turn on the kitchen lights, unless I specify which one, she either won't respond or says she doesn't understand. It might just be me, but I'd like Alexa to be polite and say ""you're welcome"" when I thank her. Sometimes she won't respond to me but will respond to my husband, which is kind of funny but I'd still like her to have manners."

I had an Echo for over a year, but the new one doesn't have a convenient way to adjust the volume without having to give a verbal command. This is difficult for my wife, since English is her second language and she was born in Korea. Despite this, the sound quality from the Echo is excellent, so we're going to keep it."

Didn't come in packaging, but it was sealed up and had no damage and wasn't missing anything. I like the sound quality, I see some knock it. It's not a BOSE but it's more than great for our family.

It's a lot of fun even just as a speaker, let alone what I plan to do with it.","

It works perfectly and it was sealed up with nothing missing and no damage. I'm pleased with the sound quality, even though some people may not be. It's not a BOSE, but it's more than adequate for our family. It was easy to use, and there was only a slight learning curve as it got used to my voice.

I'm not overly impressed with Alexa. When my Prime subscription ended, she wouldn't play anything. She can't distinguish between Spotify accounts, so that's not an option either.

Listen music and set timer,"

Put on some music and set a timer."
I received the echo in perfect condition. The device was easy to set up and responds quickly and without any issues. Alexa is a great addition to our family!,"

I got the echo in tip-top shape. Setting it up was a breeze and it responds quickly and without any problems. Alexa has been a great addition to our family!"
Good sound. Like it for music and scheduling. Like that i can get random thoughts recorded while I think about them. The jokes are cute!,"

I'm really enjoying the sound quality of this music and the scheduling of it. It's great that I'm able to record my random thoughts as soon as they come to me. The jokes are really funny too!"
Purchased this for myself and am just beginning to learn all that it can do.  So far am very pleased and amazed at the different actions it can perform.  Am enjoying it and looking forward to learning more about other options it provides.,"

I bought this for myself and am just starting to explore all the capabilities it has. I'm already very pleased and astonished at the different functions it can do. I'm having a great time with it and am looking forward to discovering more of its features."
"This echo is just as great as my others, even though it is smaller.","

This echo is just as impressive as the others I have, despite its smaller size."
Funny how you buy something just because it looks fun and it winds up being a totally useful part of your home!!!  Loving it!!,"

Purchasing something solely based on its appearance can be a great surprise, as it often turns out to be a practical and useful addition to your home! It's amazing!"
"I bought this to replace a &#34;Dot&#34; in my living room. Speaker is slightly better. It hears me better over the TV. Unfortunately, it doesn't understand or respond to my requests as well as the Dot. I frequently have to request 2 or 3 times to get it to do what I want. The Dot usually does exactly what I want on the first request. I don't consider it an upgrade.","

I purchased this speaker to take the place of an earlier ""Dot"" in my living room. The sound quality is slightly better, and it can hear me more clearly over the TV. However, it does not comprehend or act on my commands as efficiently as the Dot did. I often have to ask two or three times before it will do what I want, whereas the Dot usually responds to my first request. I don't consider this an improvement."
"I have had all good experience, so far with the second generation Echo. There are so many more things to learn, but I have not had the time yet. Right now, I am mostly enjoying the music, weather updates, using the alarm feature, and her personality. I have also purchased some mini smart socket yes. I am very excited to begin using them","

So far, my experiences with the second generation Echo have been positive. I haven't had the chance to explore all of its capabilities yet, but I'm already enjoying the music, weather reports, alarm, and Alexa's personality. I've also bought some mini smart sockets, and I'm really looking forward to using them."
"I’m having trouble connecting my tv to it, but I’m not exactly tech smart. I’m sure one of my grandsons will figure it out for me. So far I’ve been using it mostly for music.","

I'm having difficulty linking my television to the device, but I'm not especially tech savvy. I'm certain one of my grandchildren will be able to solve the issue for me. I've mainly been using it for music thus far."
Simply love my Echo. I hardly watch any TV at all anymore. I'm too busy listening to music. Speaker is pretty goo for its size. All the fun skills really make the echo fun for my whole family.,"

I'm completely enamored with my Echo; I hardly watch television anymore since I'm so preoccupied with music. The sound quality for its size is really good. The various capabilities on the Echo make it enjoyable for everyone in my family."
Enjoyed entire echo experience,"

I had a great time during my whole Echo experience."
Easy to set up.,"

Simple to install."
"The Echo is an amazing device.  Many times it seems very intuitive.  But at other times I ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result.  Installation was fairly straightforward, but I messed up several times simply because I thought a step was complete when it wasn't.  This actually made me lose ground until I figured that out.  My advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step.My biggest issue of the moment is that we have several Echo devices in our home and I would like to use them as intercoms (which I am told can be done).  However, I can't make any of the Echos aware of the others existence.  When I ask Alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.  I know this is likely my fault, but I would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions.  A small deal for many device savvy people, but a challenge for me.","

The Echo is a remarkable piece of technology which often appears to be quite intuitive. However, there have been occasions where I have asked for something which appears to be straightforward yet I receive no response. The installation process was not too difficult, but I did make a few mistakes because I assumed the step was finished when it wasn't. My recommendation would be to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step. At the moment, I am having difficulty getting the Echo devices in my home to function as intercoms, something I have been told is possible. When I ask Alexa for help, she responds with instructions on how to change her name, which is not what I am looking for. I understand that this is likely my fault, but I would expect the designers to make it simpler to locate the necessary instructions. It may not be a major issue for those familiar with technology, but it is a challenge for me."
We are loving Ours very much,"

We are very fond of Ours."
"I have the original Alexa and the Tap and so far the 2nd generation is the best. I'm happy to see they are making improvements with each new one.It would be great to have updates to our little A.I.'s, I think it would help out a lot with the bugs in it. All in all I am very happy with her and I can now play music throughout the whole house and adjust the bass and treble. Thank you"," Amazon

I have both the original Alexa and the Tap, and the second generation is by far the best. It's great to see that Amazon is making improvements with each new version. It would be really helpful if we could get regular updates to our A.I.s, as it would help to fix some of the bugs. I'm really pleased with Alexa, as I can now play music throughout my house and adjust the bass and treble. Thanks to Amazon for making this possible!"

I am delighted with the Echo 2nd Generation. Having Alexa available for playing music, giving the weather forecast and providing the latest news is great, and I'm sure there are even more features that we haven't discovered yet."
"I am pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of the Echo. If you are a big fan of deep bass, this might not be sufficient for you though. The potential to control your home is an option I will explore more as I evolve my home into a ""smart home"". The voice recognition is very impressive. It is stylish and fun. I have no regrets with this purchase. It is great for technically changes people. Ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly. If you have an elderly loved one, this would be a great gift. Once connected to wifi, it is very simple to use.  If you want unlimited music control, be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your personal dj! You can even have conversations with the echo. I am not embarrassed to say, that echo has made me laugh a couple times when I ask it to tell me a joke. It tells me where my packages are since I am an amazon prime addict, it comes in extremely  handy!","

I am very pleased with the sound quality of the Echo. It may not be enough for those who are big fans of deep bass, however. I am looking forward to taking advantage of the ability to control my home as I continue to make it smarter. The voice recognition is quite remarkable and it has a sleek, fun design. I don't regret buying this product; it is great for those who are not tech-savvy. Ask it to play a song or a movie and it will respond right away. If you have an elderly family member, this would be an ideal gift for them. Once it is connected to wifi, it is easy to use. If you want unlimited music control, make sure you have Amazon Prime or a premium Spotify account and you will be amazed with your personal DJ! You can even have conversations with the Echo. I am not ashamed to say that the Echo has made me giggle a few times when I have asked it to tell me a joke.

"My husband and I are what I would call &#34;late adopters&#34; when it come to technology, but we decide we would try and Echo to serve primarily as a music source.  Wow, were we amazed and the great sound!  We've also been having a great time listening to all of our favorite songs buy just asking Alexa.  I may even buy one for my elderly Dad - I think he will enjoy having one to listen to music or even place his calls to us!","

My husband and I are not the quickest to jump on the technology bandwagon, but we decided to give the Echo a shot. We were absolutely blown away by the quality of sound it produced!

I have been wanting one of these for a while now.  Bought on Prime Day and absolutely love it.,"

I have been desiring one of these items for some time. I purchased it on Prime Day and really enjoy it."
We are so glad that we got the Echo over a Bluetooth speaker. Alexa does so much more stuff than other non smart speakers out there. I personally love the timer feature. It has helped me with cooking multiple things simultaneously. Pandora integration is another feature that I use daily. So happy with out Prime Day purchase. I will get the Echo hub and a few more Echo dots in the future.,"

We were thrilled to receive an Echo instead of a Bluetooth speaker. Alexa offers far more capabilities than traditional non-smart speakers, and I'm particularly fond of the timer function. It's been a great help when I'm preparing multiple dishes. Plus, I use the Pandora integration every day. We're delighted with our Prime Day purchase, and we plan to get an Echo hub and a few extra Echo dots in the future."

"I was hesitant to buy the echo because I have the echo Dot and it seems good enough. The echo is the same except the sound quality, which I really didn't feel I needed. However, I am so glad I got it. What a difference! The sound really is far superior to the Echo Dot! Now I can listen to The Greatest Showman with a little more power!","

I was unsure if I should purchase the Echo because I already have an Echo Dot and it works just fine. The only difference between the two is the sound quality, which I didn't think was necessary. I am so glad I decided to get it anyway, though, as the sound is much better than the Echo Dot! I can now listen to The Greatest Showman with more volume!"
Sound quality is great. Still learning about all the different things I can do with it. FUN!!!,"

The audio is really impressive. I'm still discovering all the cool features it has and it's so much fun!"

It's extremely useful in simple things like spotify and audible and things like that but sometimes it doesn't answer everything I ask but it's still nice to use.,"

Voice recognition technology is incredibly helpful for basic tasks such as navigating Spotify and Audible, yet it doesn't always understand my queries. Despite this, it is still a great tool to have."
Too difficult to set up.  It keeps timing out before you can enter the password,"

Replacement for my clock radio, plus I have the echo dot on my night stand as my alarm clock..","

My seven-year-old son was given an Alexa device as a birthday present from his dad and he loves it. He can ask it anything and it has the answer, plus it helps with his homework. I got myself one on Prime Day for the bathroom so I can listen to music when I'm getting ready for work in the morning. It's so much better than a clock radio, and I have an Echo Dot on my nightstand as my alarm clock. The bass is really loud and strong."

My wife and I are both retired and she wouldn't have been able to install Alexa, but if my son wasn't supplying her with a smart phone we wouldn't be using Alexa yet.","

I had hoped that the set-up for Alexa would be more user-friendly, but it wasn't as simple as I had anticipated. Fortunately, the Alexa app can be downloaded to a PC without needing to install any intrusive drivers. My wife and I are both retired, so it would have been difficult for her to install Alexa on her own. If it hadn't been for my son providing her with a smartphone, we would not be using Alexa yet."

I love that the refurbished item works just like it's brand new. Setting it up was a breeze, which I absolutely adore. The only downside is that the volume isn't very loud, so if you're just lounging around it's okay, but if you need to do something else, I suggest getting a separate speaker."
But not very loud,"

However, not very loudly"
This is our 2nd one and we love it!,"

This thing barely works. You have to select 3rd party apps to do stuff you'd think it could do out of the box. I'm sending mine back asap. Waste of money.,"

This product is practically useless. You need to download additional applications to do basic functions that should be included in the original package. I am returning mine immediately. It was a terrible purchase."
Gift for my man. He doesn’t like that you have to plug it in and the pictures do not show the cord. Would prefer it cordless. Still works though for the purpose we bought it.,"

We have now bought our fifth Amazon Echo device, and just like the refurbished ones we have purchased before, we are satisfied with this one too.

I wanted to use these as a radio and intercom as we get terrible fm reception where i live.  The speech recognition software is horrible.  My wife and i both are native Americans whose language is English she is from the north i am from Texas  neither have an accent from our birth area and yet it does not do a good job understanding us.  We bought two they do the same thing.  Additionally wifi reception was poor to marginal. I had to buy Wifi range extender for office and the other is ten feet from our router.  Both had problems Switched them around no difference.  So it they are now disconnected dust collectors.,"

I wanted to use these devices as a radio and intercom, as the FM reception where I live is terrible. Unfortunately, the speech recognition software was not up to par; both my wife and I are native English speakers, and neither of us have accents from our respective places of birth, yet the software still had a hard time understanding us. We purchased two of these devices, and the WiFi reception was either poor or marginal. I had to buy a WiFi range extender for one of them, and the other was placed only ten feet away from our router, yet both still experienced issues.

"Already owning a couple of Echos, I was frustrated that I couldn’t also use them as intercoms. Finally Amazon enables the “drop-in” feature so now I can use my Echos to reach out to family in remote parts of the house (and teenagers who insist they never heard me yelling at them to come down to dinner).As for its other features, we mainly use our Echos for the standard stuff: playing music, setting alarms, answering questions, etc. It's not the life-changing home device Amazon would have you believe, but it is convenient to have around. This refurb saved me a few bucks, looks and works the same as the other brand-new ones.","

We mainly use our Echos for typical activities like playing music, setting alarms, and responding to questions. It's not as revolutionary as Amazon advertises, but it's still a convenient tool to have. This refurbished model saved me money and works just like a new one."

Alexa would tell me it’s ready to connect and freeze mid sentence. Tried holding the action button for 5 seconds and it didn’t do anything. Returning immediately and hope they actually fix this item when the next buyer purchases it.","

This item did not function as it should have, even though it was certified refurbished.

"A small problem out of the box, but a rep from Amazon called and walked me through a reset process which solved my issues. I was shocked to get a response so quickly and a real effort was made (including follow up email) to get this thing working. I have 6 now (and one google clone) and the more I use it, and learn about it, the more I like it (them). I also plan to install one in my car, boat and garage. Alexa is my new best friend!?!?

I have a great time with my Alexa Dot - playing games with my son, finding out the weather, and integrating it with my Amazon Fire TV."
I like it because you could ask it different questions and it does different things it works intermittently with my smart TV if I ask you to change the volume it does or does it sometimes if I ask you to change the channel it does or doesn't sometimes I have to reset it I don't know if it's because it's refurbished but it's okay it's just not what I expected,"

I enjoy using it because I can ask it various questions and it can do different tasks. However, it doesn't always work with my smart TV. Sometimes it will change the volume when asked, but other times it won't. Similarly, it may or may not change the channel when asked. I have to reset it occasionally, but I'm not sure if that's because it's a refurbished model or not. It's alright, just not what I anticipated."
"So far the certified refurbished Echo Dot works well. It was a little confusing to have a green ring on the Echo Dot and not 100% know why it was there. Asked Alexa and she said it was because of a receiving a call or drop in. But that was not the case. Took about 10 minutes to figure out it was a notification that I had a delivery from amazon. I believe the ring is supposed to be yellow and pulsate for a message notification, but on my refurbished Echo Dot it was Green and pulsed.","

The certified refurbished Echo Dot I bought has been working well so far. Initially, I was confused by the green ring on the Echo Dot and wasn't sure what it meant. I asked Alexa and she said it was because of a call or drop in, but that wasn't the case. After around 10 minutes, I realized it was a notification that I had a delivery from Amazon. I think the ring should be yellow and pulse for message notifications, however, on my refurbished Echo Dot it was green and pulsing."

"Works as advertised. Speak clearly, and research the commands. Also. Get the wall holder, it keeps it out of the way. Set up is a breeze, just make sure you are close to the device initially when connecting your phone. For some reason it made set up easier...though it could be psychological haha","

Make sure you speak clearly and do your research on the commands before you use them. Additionally, purchase the wall holder to keep the device out of the way. Setting up is a breeze, however, it is best to be close to the device at first when pairing your phone. For some reason, this made the set up process simpler, although it may just be in my head!"

"There was something wrong with the first one that no even the rep I spoke with could fix. The replacement was registered to someone else. When the price of the Dot went down to $39.99 (same price as the refurbished ones), I bought a brand, spanking new one. No problem with the new one.","

The first one had an issue that even the representative I spoke with was unable to repair. It was registered to someone else. When the Dot's price dropped to $39.99, the same as the refurbished ones, I bought a brand new one and it worked perfectly."

I'm delighted with the cost of this practically brand new Echo Dot! When I opened it up, it was hard to tell that it had been refurbished. Everything looked like it was just out of the box. This was a great deal, with a savings of $20 compared to buying a new one. I'm really impressed with the Echo Dot's many uses, so get one while they're still available!"

I am an avid Amazon fan and love the brand for their unlimited digital music, prime videos, and even their online games, music, and movies.

"I love Alexa, but the sound on the dot is not the best. I own an echo 2nd gen for the kitchen/living room and got this for my bedroom, but there’s a SIGNIFICANT difference in sound. The dot lacks a full base sound and sounds as if it’s coming off a cheap portable speaker. I was REALLY disappointed. I returned it right away and just shelled out the money to buy a second echo 2 for my bedroom also.","

I'm a huge fan of Alexa, but the sound quality of the dot isn't great. I have an Echo 2nd gen for the kitchen/living room, and got the dot for my bedroom, but the difference in sound was huge. The dot doesn't have the same depth of sound and it sounds like a cheap portable speaker. I was so let down that I returned it immediately and bought a second Echo 2 for my bedroom."
"Took me awhile to get it connected. I'm not electronically savy but now that it is, I love it.","

It took me a while to get it set up, as I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to electronic devices, but now that it's connected, I'm really enjoying it."

Not substitute for the original.  The echo dot performs well but sound quality is poor.  To listen it has to be at the highest level 10.,"

The performance of the Echo Dot is satisfactory, however, its audio quality is not ideal. To hear it clearly, the volume needs to be turned up to the maximum level of 10."

"Stopped working after 7 months. The warranty was only good for 3 months. I would have assumed an amazon product sold on amazon would have had higher standards than guaranteeing that it would work for 3 whole months. I mean what is this product supposed to be, a piece of junk?They offered my a 15% discount if I wanted to buy another one. Why would I want to buy another one?","

I was really disappointed when the product stopped working after only 7 months, as the warranty was only valid for 3 months. I expected Amazon to have higher standards than this, as it implies that the product is of poor quality. The fact that they offered me a 15% discount for a replacement was of no interest to me, as why would I want to buy another one?"

"I received my Echo Dot today in good condition, but be advised: I paid $29.99 for it and Amazon has (as of this writing) raised the price to $39.99, so do your research before buying so you can get a good deal!Set up with the Dot went simple enough — plug it in, follow the app instructions... except initially it took a while to actually show up in my iPhone’s WiFi settings. I called Amazon customer service, and I dunno what it is, but lately I’ve been getting terrible support. The guy that took my call just rambled off a (completely unhelpful) script and I ended up setting up the Dot while he was in the middle of his spiel.I’m not sure if this is the norm or if it’s because this is refurbished, but the Dot has a pretty finicky wifi range and randomly disconnects even though the app shows that the range of my 5GHz connection is strong. Reconnecting is a pain each time as well.All that said, when Alexa works, she works amazingly well. I don’t have a speaker hooked up to it, but one thing I really enjoy is the mic’s range and sensitivity. One of the more annoying limitations of Apple’s Siri is that when she’s playing audio through device speakers (music, podcasts, etc), the “Hey Siri” feature is all but useless. Alexa has no problem hearing me over whatever is playing at the time, and with amazingly fast responsiveness too. I haven’t tried this with louder speakers yet, so I’m not sure if this will continue to hold true.Setting up Alexa to control all my wireless devices was a breeze, albeit with limitations — support for Arlo devices is nil, and if you have special settings for your LED devices (eg. rainbow effects), Alexa can’t handle them, she only knows how to change solid colors and brightness levels.All in all, my rating would’ve been lower had I not gotten a decent price on this item. If the connectivity problems persist, I may have to exchange/return this item. I don’t want to though — Alexa’s kind of growing on me.","I recently got my Echo Dot and it was in good condition.

I bought it because everyone was saying how much they love theirs. But I have no need for it. I only used it once. The volume was not loud enough for me when I played music while I was on my treadmill. So I rather use my tower speaker which is 3xs louder.,"

I purchased the item based on the positive feedback from others, but I found I had no real use for it. After trying it out once, I realized that the volume was not sufficient for me when I was running on my treadmill with music playing. Therefore, I decided to go with my tower speaker which is much louder."

This device is really terrible; I'm not sure if it's because it's a refurbished model or something else, but it just started talking on its own without anyone speaking. You have to shout really loudly in order to be heard."

"I took a chance on a certified refurbished unit for $29. Looks brand new...no excuses or disappointments. 5 minute trouble-free set up! Effortless bluetooth speaker connectivity through the Alexa App on my iPhone was flawless. Listening to my favorite tunes through a Bose Bluetooth setup and couldn't be happier. Walk through the door and just ask Alexa to: &#34;Play 80's music&#34; and viola... instant atmosphere! No more opening the iPad, going to settings, turning on bluetooth and then accessing the Pandora app. It just makes things so effortless. A true joy right out of the box! If I didn't discover any other uses for this fine piece of technology it was worth every penny!","

I decided to take a gamble on a certified pre-owned device for only $29, and it looks like it's never been used. It was easy to set up in a matter of minutes, and connecting to my Bose Bluetooth speakers with the Alexa app on my iPhone went without a hitch. Listening to my favorite tunes with the Bose system was great. Now, all I have to do is tell Alexa to ""Play 80's music"" and I'm set! No more messing around with the iPad, turning on Bluetooth, and going through the Pandora app. It's so much simpler now. Even if this was the only use I got out of it, it was worth every penny!"

I am obsessed with my Alexa Echo Dot! I now have two of them - one brand new and one pre-owned. Both of them are functioning perfectly and I use them for so many things.

I'm not impressed at all so far. It doesn't save groups properly and it rarely understands me. I don't understand what the hype is about. Alexa's voice sounds like it's coming from underwater, so how am I supposed to understand it?! I'm going to return it and get a Google Home instead."

Just shout out &#34;Alexa, What time is it?&#34; if i could just figure out how to get it to do house hold chores and walk the dogs it'd be golden! sound is not that great but with its size what can you expect. The Echo Plus has much better audio but that is what you get with the larger more expensive Echo.","

I've been using the Echo to control my TV lights and other gadgets, which works great. It's also been helpful when I wake up and don't want to open my eyes to check the time--I just ask Alexa what time it is. The sound quality isn't the best, but that's to be expected for such a small device. The Echo Plus has much better audio, but you have to pay more for that larger device. If only I could figure out how to get it to do chores and walk the dogs, it would be perfect!"

The speaker is not terrible for sound quality."
"This is a great device. We mainly use it to verbally add things to the shopping list, but occasionally use any number of the &#34;fun&#34; things you can program it to do, like go to Red Alert or make the TARDIS land (yes, we're a house of geeks... we even chose the wake-word to be &#34;Computer&#34; instead of &#34;Alexa&#34;. Now we just need Majel Barret's voice and I will be in geek heaven.) ;)It's not as easy to get my Premium Spotify to work properly with it, and still not sure how we can get multiple music accounts attached so we can listen to different music in different rooms, but so far it's still been worth it. I am often asking it the time, the weather, it even gives us a news briefing. We also use it as an intercom system which has been really awesome. Plus it's fun knowing the NSA is listening to everything.","

This device is amazing! We mostly use it to make grocery lists, but we also take advantage of its ""fun"" capabilities, like activating Red Alert and making the TARDIS land (we're all big geeks in this house, so we even made the wake-word ""Computer"" instead of ""Alexa""! I would be in heaven if Majel Barret's voice was the one giving us the commands). Unfortunately, getting my Premium Spotify to work with it has been a bit of a hassle and I haven't figured out how to get multiple music accounts so different people in different rooms can listen to different music. Still, it's been worth it. I often ask it for the time and the weather, and it even gives us a news briefing. We also use it as an intercom system, which has been really useful.

I would give Echo dot an ""A"" in terms of its music playing capabilities, as I heard songs that I had not heard on mainstream radio stations. It is also amusing when Alexa responds with ""I don't know that,"" such as when I asked her why she thought yards of cotton fabric were related to football playing. If I had paid full price for this device, I would have been very dissatisfied. However, now it appears to be a good value and much better than HAL."
"Brought to replace one that I moved and doesn't have the same range as my previous (non refurbished) unit. It would seldom be able to find the Wi-Fi and couldn't connect. Got tired of hearing the message (&#34;trouble connecting...check the Alexa app...&#34;) and just unplugged it. I went through the troubleshooting and reconnected it several times, it's just not as strong.","

I replaced my old (non refurbished) Wi-Fi unit with a new one, but it doesn't have the same range. It often has difficulty finding the Wi-Fi and connecting, and I got tired of hearing the message “trouble connecting...check the Alexa app...” so I unplugged it. I tried troubleshooting and reconnecting it multiple times, but it just isn't as strong."
"If you want to listen to music and have it come through several of the Echo/Dot units simultaneously, YOU MUST PAY A MONTHLY FEE. I thought this was Amazon, not Apple??!! I’ve paid for many of these so I could have one in each room, is that not enough of my money??!!??","

If you want to have music playing through multiple Echo/Dot devices at the same time, you have to pay a monthly fee? That doesn't make sense to me! I've already bought multiple of these devices so I could have one in each room, why do I have to pay more money?"
"Purchased as a gift,"," the necklace was a hit

"Overall good device. It was bought for a workout room, and has issues reaching a volume that can be heard over a standard row machine. It could use a much better speaker.","

This device is generally satisfactory, however it has difficulty reaching a loud enough volume to be heard over a row machine when used in a workout room. It would be beneficial to install a higher quality speaker."
Works great and simple to set up. Alexa is way more accurate than I imagined so Im using it more than I thought. Wish alarms could be set a bit further out but thats my only complaint.No she's not listening when you don't say the wake word so if you're worried you can lose the conspiracy theories. The speaker is great too so don't hold off on getting one if you were turned off by gen 1 like me.,"

Alexa works really well and was a breeze to set up. I'm pleasantly surprised by how accurate it is and I'm using it more than I expected. My only issue is that I wish the alarms could be set further ahead of time. But, rest assured that Alexa won't be listening to you unless you say the wake word, so you don't need to worry about any conspiracy theories. The speaker is also really great, so if you were hesitant to get one due to the first generation, don't let that stop you."
The voice clarity has made my eavesdropping efforts so much easier - the government. :),"

The excellent sound quality of the audio has made it much simpler for me to eavesdrop on the government."
Worked perfect,"

"Had a little trouble at the beginning until I replaced my old router and it works good except for current temperature and at times Alexa will be off by as much as 10 degrees!  Like when it was 91 degrees, Alexa would say it was 81 degrees.  Otherwise, everything works as expected and enjoy listening to music from Amazon and my Pandora stations and requesting my favorite song or recording artist.","

Initially, I experienced some difficulty, but after I swapped out my old router, it has been running smoothly - apart from the occasional discrepancy in temperature readings. For instance, when the actual temperature was 91 degrees, Alexa would report 81 degrees. Other than that, everything is functioning as anticipated and I'm pleased to be able to listen to music from Amazon and my Pandora stations, as well as request my favorite songs and artists."
I bought three of these and all three have worked flawlessly. If they weren't labeled as refurbished I wouldn't have known,"

I purchased three of these items and all of them have performed perfectly. If they had not been labeled as refurbished, I would have been unaware."
"This device works perfectly and was a good price.  We love Alexa and are having great fun with her.  The music is great and we get the radio stations we need for our morning traffic report.  I didn’t think I would enjoy having AI in the house, but it is fun, educational and entertaining even for people who aren’t tech savvy.","

This device is functioning optimally and was a great deal. We are really enjoying Alexa and having a blast with her. The music is awesome and we can easily get our daily traffic report from the radio stations. I was unsure if I would be comfortable with having an AI in the home, but it is enjoyable, informative, and amusing even for those who are not tech-inclined."
Eh. It’s works on and off. Half the time it does not respond when you say wake up name. Other then that works fine,"

Sometimes it responds when you say its name, but other times it doesn't work properly. Apart from that, it functions well."

I have both the first and second generation Echo Dot. I personally prefer the volume ring of the first gen compared to the buttons on the second gen, but it still works well and is a great bargain for the price I paid. I would still highly recommend it."

"It works great, but the reason I'm leaving 3 stars is because it wont play unless it plugged in the whole time. Pretty irritating especially when there is no outlet available.","

It's like having your own personal assistant, computer, and all the other necessary tools in one convenient package - I absolutely love it!"
"The problem I have with this item could just be my inexperience. I ordered the wrong thing, but then decided I’d set it up and use Alexa. I was trying to replace a small Bluetooth speaker in my bedroom. Thought I could learn as I go. I downloaded the app, but never could get the Echo to sync with my iPhone. I’ve decided to give this to one of my kids and they will probably enjoy it and use it as it is intended.","

I made a mistake when I ordered this item, but I decided to try and set it up regardless. I was looking to replace a Bluetooth speaker in my bedroom, so I thought I'd learn as I went.

I had a brand new echo Dot and thought that the refurbished would be just as good. It was quite different from my expectations. Refurbished unit did not even turn on and after a while I realized that the power adapter was faulty. There is no way for me to have Amazon send me a power adapter by itself according to the return options. I love Amazon and buy even my toilet paper through them but this was truly a let down.Update: Amazon contacted me and credited me enough to buy a new power adapter. This is why I shop on Amazon. I can always trust them to deliver on their products.,"

I recently purchased a refurbished Echo Dot and was disappointed to find that it didn't even turn on. After inspecting the device, I discovered that the power adapter was faulty and Amazon does not offer the option to send a power adapter by itself. I was disheartened by the experience, as I usually rely on Amazon for all of my shopping needs. However, Amazon contacted me and provided me with enough credit to purchase a new power adapter. This is why I continue to shop with Amazon - I know I can trust them to deliver on their promises."

If u r almost deaf, you can hear her alarm in the bedroom from out in the living room, so that is reason enough to keep her.It is fun to ask random questions to hear her response.  She does not seem to be very smartbon politics yet.","

Without having a cellphone, I cannot take advantage of many of its features. I have an iPad, but that does not seem to be of any use.

She does not appear to be very knowledgeable when it comes to politics."

We are fond of the dimensions of the 2nd generation echo, yet the sound quality could use a bit of refinement."
"I liked the original Echo. This is the same but shorter and with greater fabric/color choices. I miss the volume ring on top, now it's just the plus/minus buttons. Not a big deal but the ring w as comforting. :) Other than that, well I do like the use of a standard USB charger /port instead of the previous round pin. Other than that, I guess it sounds the same, seems to work the same, still answers to Alexa/Echo/Computer. So what's not to like? :)","

I enjoyed the original Echo, but this one is more compact with a wider selection of colors and fabrics. I do wish, however, that it had a volume ring on top like the previous one; the plus and minus buttons don't give me the same feeling of security. On the other hand, I do appreciate the use of a USB charger/port instead of the round pin. Otherwise, it seems to be similar in sound and performance and still responds to Alexa, Echo, and Computer. All in all, I'm quite pleased with it!"
Love the Echo and how good the music sounds playing off it. Alexa understands most commands but it is difficult at times for her to find specific playlists or songs on Spotify. She is good with Amazon Music but is lacking in other major programs.,"

I adore the Echo and how wonderful the music sounds when played through it. Alexa is usually able to comprehend most commands, but it can be challenging for her to pinpoint certain Spotify playlists or songs. She performs admirably with Amazon Music, but she is not as proficient with other major streaming services."
"We love Alexa! We use her to play music, play radio through iTunes, play podcasts through Anypod, and set reminders. We listen to our flash briefing of news and weather every morning.

We absolutely adore Alexa! We use her to listen to music, tune into radio stations through iTunes, listen to podcasts with Anypod, and set up reminders. Every morning we hear our personalized news and weather briefing. We also really appreciate our custom lists. The ability to control the volume with our voice is very convenient. We're certain that we'll discover new ways to utilize Alexa in the future. Although it can be a bit irritating when Alexa doesn't comprehend us."

She is great at her job and has the ability to learn commands for unique owners and users. For example, you could ask Alexa to ""learn"" Tasha's birthday or ""learn"" your definition of ""fine""."
The speakers sound pretty good for being so small and setup is pretty easy.  I bought two and the reason I only rate it a 3 is I have followed the instructions for synching music to both units.  I know I've done it correctly but they won't sync.  That was my primary motivation for purchasing multiple units.,"

The speakers are quite good for their size, and the setup process is simple. I purchased two, but I'm only giving them a 3-star rating because I followed the instructions for syncing music to both units and they still won't sync. This was the primary reason why I bought two of them."
This device is awesome!,"

This device is incredible!"
I bought this to compare the speaker quality to our first generation speaker and i like the sound better.  I will ship this to my daughter though because I like the fact that my first generation has a chargeable base that we bought which keeps it more mobile and she needs a better sound than what she has now.,"

I got this to evaluate how it sounded compared to our original speaker, and I was pleased with the outcome. I'm sending it to my daughter though, since the first one has a charging base that makes it more portable, and she needs an upgrade on the sound she currently has."

This item is really awesome! You should consider purchasing one if you want to be fashionable."
"This is my first digital assistant so I'm giving this a good review. Speaker is really good for the cheap price on Prime day. Fun to play with and can be used as an alarm clock (That's what I was going to get in the first place, but I ended up with Echo). If you haven't had a go with one then definitely try it!What I like best is the number of other devices that it can connect with. My purchase came with a Smart Plug for $10 which I connect my lamp to. Alexa, turn of the lights!","

I'm really impressed with my first digital assistant, especially considering the great deal I got on Prime Day! It was fun to play with and I'm using it as an alarm clock. If you haven't tried one out yet, I'd definitely recommend it. The best part for me is the fact that it can connect to other devices - I got a Smart Plug for an additional $10 which I've connected to my lamp. Now I can just say ""Alexa, turn off the lights!"" and it's done!"
My husband likes being able to use it to listen to music.  I wish we knew all it's capabilities,"

"It's like Siri, in fact, Siri answers more accurately then Alexa.  I don't see a real need for it in my household, though it was a good bargain on prime day deals.","

No different than Apple. To play a specific list of music you must have an Amazon of Spotify “plus/prime/etc” account.  So you must pay to play “your” music.  3 stars for that reason.  Everything else is 👍🏻 .,"

It's the same as Apple: you need an Amazon or Spotify ""Plus/Prime/etc"" account to access a particular selection of music, so you have to pay to listen to your own music. For that reason, I give it three stars. All other aspects are great."

"I bought this because it can control fios television. It works well. I’m hoping over time it will do more to control fios. Then I discovered all the other things Alexa can do. Play music you ask for. Great sound from Alexa. Play games. Play radio stations. Play old time radio programs like the Long Ranger. Alexa has many “apps” you can add to her abilities. The other day I played Madlibs. Great fun. Also Alexa can control household appliances. I just purchased Alexa compatible power strips to control lighting, fans and TV components. I’m looking forward to implementing this controll. You can also add other Alexa components to have chosen music to play in all rooms where the components are located.","

I got this because it is able to manage my Fios TV, and it works well. I am hoping that it will be able to do more in the future. After I got it, I found out that Alexa can do a lot of other things too. For example, it can play the music you request, with great sound quality. It can also play games, radio stations, and old-time radio programs like The Lone Ranger. Moreover, Alexa has many “apps” that you can install to increase its abilities. The other day, I even played Madlibs with it. It was really fun. Furthermore, Alexa can also control household appliances. I recently bought Alexa-compatible power strips to control the lighting, fans, and TV components. I am looking forward to using this control. You can also add other Alexa components to have your chosen music playing in all the rooms where the components are located."

"Love it! I was thinking about getting one and when the prime day discount was offered, I could not pass it up! It's fun to ask Alexa to play any song or group and she comes up with a playlist from Amazon Prime Music. You can also connect your iPhone with bluetooth and play music with Pandora or YouTube videos using Alexa as a speaker. I've been having fun asking Alexa different types of questions or for information like weather, news or even the time in other countries. The only downside is if you have limited data on your wifi plan, because Alexa uses burns it up when playing music.","

I was really excited when I saw the Prime Day deal and decided to buy it. It's been a blast using Alexa to play songs, create playlists from Amazon Prime Music, or connect my iPhone via bluetooth to listen to Pandora or watch YouTube videos. I've also been having a good time asking Alexa questions about the weather, news, and the time in other countries. The only downside is that Alexa uses up a lot of data when streaming music, so if you have a limited data plan on your wifi, that could be a problem."

I am a huge fan of the Echo! I adore its size, the material it is made out of, and the quality of the speaker. I was able to set it up with one light switch quickly, and I plan to connect it to further lights and a thermostat. After that, I will be getting an Echo Dot for my bedroom. There are so many more things that can be done with the Echo than you might expect - like getting traffic updates, checking the weather, playing trivia games, and more."

But it definitely feels like echo gen 1 sound quality was better.Besides that , it’s great.With the addition of being able to play Just over Bluetooth with no WiFi, it’s even better.","

Although the product is still great, the sound quality does appear to be worse. I don't want to be too critical, as you eventually get accustomed to it within an hour. However, it feels like the sound quality of the Echo Generation 1 was better. Other than that, it is a great product and even better with the added capability of playing it over Bluetooth without needing WiFi."
The outlet does not work with it. Was disappointed in that.,"

I was disappointed that the outlet wasn't functioning."

Sound is terrible if u want good music too get a bose,"

If you want quality music, get a Bose speaker, as sound quality is poor otherwise."
"i liked the sound . what is troubling is that I paid extra money to have access to a million more songs. Sometimes it doesn't work. Ex. Alexa play Italian songs&#34; .don't have or don&#34; t understand. or play the opera Tosca, response &#34;sorry I don&#34;t have that.","

I enjoyed the audio, however, I was disappointed to have spent extra money to have access to a million more songs that don't always work. For example, when I ask Alexa to play Italian songs, she responds with ""I don't have that"" or when I ask her to play the opera Tosca, she says ""sorry, I don't understand""."
Easy to set up and use. Too bad it has to be plugged in. Would be nice to take it outside and operate on battery and recharged.,"

It's convenient to get up and running, but a shame it needs to be plugged in. It would be great if it could be taken outside and used with a battery that can be recharged."
Still learning all the ways to use it.  It is a real hit with my grandkids who ask it to play music and then dance to it.  (5 and 7 yrs).  Very cute.,"

I'm still discovering all the functions of it, and my grandchildren, aged five and seven, absolutely love it! They ask it to play music and then dance to it - it's really adorable."
"4.5 out of 5 Stars. I generally like this product. Its great at doing what you ask of it like playing music, setting timers, and making calls. Reason why I didn't rate it 5 out of 5 is that sometimes the connection dies and my Echo stops playing music and shows a red ring. Seems to be a connection issue. Overall, great product.","

I generally have a positive opinion of this product. It is great at doing what it is meant to do, such as playing music, setting timers, and making calls. The only reason I did not give it a full 5 stars is because the connection sometimes drops and my Echo stops playing music and displays a red ring. It appears to be an issue with the connection. Despite this, I think it is an excellent product."

"So far it seems to be a very nice item. It picks up on my voice and understands me without any problems. The other day I asked it to turn down the music from the next room and it heard me just fine. I've only used it to listen to music and check the weather, but it has done both of those things very well.","

So far, the item appears to be great. It recognizes my voice and comprehends my requests with ease. For instance, I recently asked it to lower the music from an adjacent room and it heard me loud and clear. I've only used it to play music and check the forecast, but both of those functions have been working wonderfully."

I am very fond of her; she is extremely useful. I rely on her for remembering things and getting some rest. You can query her about almost anything. I have only had her for about a week, so I am still learning her."
"It's better than the 1st gen in every way except for one.  I really miss the ring at the top for volume control.  It was quicker and easier to just grab the top and twist without having to look at the buttons and find the &#34;-&#34; one and press it a few times.  I also wish the bass was a bit better.  All in all, it's a great device and I'm happy with it.","

This new model is an improvement over the first generation in almost every way, but I do miss the ring at the top for adjusting the volume. It was so convenient to just twist the ring without having to look for the correct button. Additionally, I would have liked a bit more bass. Nevertheless, I am still pleased with the device overall."

it's annoying that everything they show Alexa as being able to do has to be downloaded. You spend so  much time trying to figure out how to phrase it for the machine that you may as well just look it up yourself,"

It is frustrating that in order to access all of Alexa's features, you have to download them. You spend so much time trying to figure out how to phrase your request for the machine that it would be quicker to just look it up yourself."
I have had Alexa since the beginning.  I accidentally spilled water on her and have replaced it with the 2nd generation.  I decided I couldn't be without an Echo.  Setup was easy and had it working within minutes.,"

I got Alexa from the start and unfortunately spilled water on her, so I had to get the 2nd generation. I couldn't bear to be without an Echo, and it was simple to set up - I was up and running in no time."

He doesn't understand most of the questions he's asked. He can't figure out how to connect his sprinkler wifi controller, even though the product details state that it's compatible.

The only thing he can do is use it as a music player, but only if you have Amazon Music."

I'm really enjoying being able to request any kind of music I want from Prime through Alexa. While I appreciated the informative photo pamphlet, I wish it had included instructions on how to connect my TV to the commands from Alexa. Nonetheless, I'm thrilled to have access to the music."
"i have not found a way to access my echo thorough my prime account.  I think it should be part of the top line with video, music, etc.  I also think the setup app where i define, for example music i like, is not well integrated into echo.  I have tried to ask for my playlist and echo is not sure even though i set up play list in my settings.  I also do not like the fact that my words have to be exact match of my playlist names, which i can never remember.I like the ready nature of echo to respond to most any queries.","

I have not been able to figure out how to link my Echo device to my Prime account. I believe it should be more prominently displayed with other features like video, music, etc. Additionally, I feel that the setup app which allows me to specify preferences such as the music I like, is not well integrated with the Echo. When I have asked Echo to play my playlists, it has not been able to recognize them, despite me setting them up in my settings. I also do not like the fact that I have to remember the exact name of my playlist in order for Echo to understand me. On the other hand, I do appreciate the fact that Echo is able to respond to most queries without any difficulty."

"During Prime Day this 2nd gen Echo was on sale so I couldn't resist! This was the beginning to my smart home set up and I couldn't be happier to say that Alexa has done an amazing job connecting to all of my ""smart"" devices. Thanks to her, I can control my lights, smart plugs, TV, etc. I had no trouble connecting the Echo to my WiFi and my phone. The app works perfectly fine and it let's you add skills, routines, smart devices, timers, and so much more! Sound quality is good enough for me, since I am not an audiophile. Alexa can hear my voice even when watching movies at a high volume. Design is great and modern, it will definitely add a nice touch to your home and you can change the covers if you'd like as there are more for sale. Overall, this is a great addition to my home and enables so many possibilities. If you haven't yet, be sure to add Alexa to your home!","

I was so excited to take advantage of the Prime Day sale on the 2nd gen Echo and now I'm so glad I did! I've set up my smart home using Alexa and she does a great job connecting to all my devices. It was easy to link the Echo to my WiFi and my phone, and the app works really well - I can add skills, routines, devices, and more. The sound quality is good enough for me and Alexa can hear me even when there's a lot of background noise. The design is modern and looks great, plus I can change the cover if I want to. All in all, this Echo has been a great addition to my home and I'm sure it will be to yours too, so be sure to consider it if you're looking to upgrade your home!"

"It performs pretty much as expected, but I am very disappointed it will not provide me with the terminology I need to play various kinds of music without subscribing to the Amazon music service.  I understand my music choices may be limited, but without knowing HOW TO ASK, I cannot access the music that is provided free along with my Echo purchase.  Do you have a chart showing the language I need to use?","

I am very let down that my Echo does not offer me the words I need to access different kinds of music without signing up for Amazon music. I comprehend my options may be restricted, but I can't get to the music that comes with my Echo unless I know what to say. Is there a diagram that displays the phrases I ought to use?"

"My mom bought a few Echo Dots and repeated ask me to take one of hers because it was so great. I told her “no” for two days. When she made me take it, 6 hours later I could not live my life without it!  It’s that amazing, so now we have four large speakers and only the small Echo Dot, that I will be returning to her. I say if you’re going to order an Alexa speaker, go big and get the Echo, otherwise tou’ll Be returning the two Echo Dots you couldn’t live without.","

My mom got a couple of Echo Dots and kept insisting I take one of hers because it was so incredible. I said ""no"" for two days, but eventually I gave in. Six hours later, I found myself unable to live without it! It's that amazing, so now we have four big speakers and just the tiny Echo Dot, which I'm going to give back to her.

My fault for not checking this, but made the assumption that a company has technologically advanced as Amazon would sell this product with a rechargeable battery.  If I could return it, I would as my Apple music and boom speaker give me more flexibility the Alexa.","

I'm extremely let down that Alexa must be plugged into a wall outlet all the time. It's my mistake for not researching this, but I assumed that a company as advanced as Amazon would make this device with a rechargeable battery. If I could take it back, I would because my Apple music and boom speaker offer me more freedom than Alexa does."
I don't think the &#34;2nd gen&#34; sounds as good as the 1st.  But it does have an aux out... so you could add an external speaker.  But if you are going to do that why wouldn't you just get a dot?  2nd issue is (which isn't unique to this unit but I don't understand why I can't override the default that prevents you from playing a blue tooth speaker while playing through a &#34;group&#34;.  I get there is a delay when using a BT speaker.  But if the other units are not where they can be heard then I should be able to play as a group while using the BT speaker.,"

I don't think the ""2nd gen"" sounds as good as the 1st, but it does have an aux out so you could attach an external speaker. If you want to do that, why not just get a Dot?

I get that there is a delay when using a Bluetooth speaker, but if the other units are not in a place where they can be heard then I should be able to play as a group while using the Bluetooth speaker."

"Love my new addition to the house! Speaker quality is great and over all we love our Alexa. My only two ( not complaints, more suggestions for the future series) would be better communication ability. Example: For our smart lights in the house. Unless we specify kitchen Light 1 or kitchen Light 2 prior to the command she either won’t respond or says she doesn’t recognize. It may be me, but I want my Alexa to respond when I say thank you afterwards. I have to repeat Alexa thank you and there are times she won’t respond to me, but will my husband. I know it sounds odd. We laugh about it, but maybe it’s a Southern thing but I want my Alexa to have manners too.","

We are really enjoying our new addition to the house! The sound quality is great and we are all loving Alexa. If we had two requests for the future, it would be for better communication ability. For example, when we ask for the kitchen lights, unless we specify which one, Alexa either won't respond or says she doesn't understand. I also want Alexa to respond when I say thank you afterwards; sometimes she won't respond to me, but she will respond to my husband. We find it funny, but I would like Alexa to have good manners too!"

Didn't come in packaging, but it was sealed up and had no damage and wasn't missing anything. I like the sound quality, I see some knock it. It's not a BOSE but it's more than great for our family.

It's a lot of fun even just as a speaker, let alone what I plan to do with it.","

"Awesome life changer! Seriously, I am able to start my morning with Alexa, by having her &#34;wake&#34;me up with  her alarm and then playing me some music. She has gotten used to my voice, that I can be in another room and she will &#34;listen&#34; to what I say. I love both my echos!!!

I've been so pleased with my purchase and Alexa's capabilities!"
"I am not super impressed with Alexa. When my Prime lapsed, she wouldn't play anything. She isn't smart enough to differentiate among spotify accounts so we can't use it for that either. She randomly speaks up when nobody is talking to her. Just today I unplugged her...not sure I'll ever use my Alexa again.","

I am not very pleased with Alexa. When my Prime subscription expired, she was unable to play anything.

"I bought this to replace a &#34;Dot&#34; in my living room. Speaker is slightly better. It hears me better over the TV. Unfortunately, it doesn't understand or respond to my requests as well as the Dot. I frequently have to request 2 or 3 times to get it to do what I want. The Dot usually does exactly what I want on the first request. I don't consider it an upgrade.","

I purchased this to take the place of a ""Dot"" in my living room. The speaker is a bit better, as it can detect me better over the TV. However, it does not comprehend or react to my commands as well as the Dot does. Often, I have to ask it two or three times before it will do what I want it to. The Dot usually responds to my first request. I do not think of this as an improvement."
"I have had all good experience, so far with the second generation Echo. There are so many more things to learn, but I have not had the time yet.

Easy to set up.,"

Simple to install."
"The Echo is an amazing device.  Many times it seems very intuitive.  But at other times I ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result.  Installation was fairly straightforward, but I messed up several times simply because I thought a step was complete when it wasn't.  This actually made me lose ground until I figured that out.  My advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step.My biggest issue of the moment is that we have several Echo devices in our home and I would like to use them as intercoms (which I am told can be done).  However, I can't make any of the Echos aware of the others existence.  When I ask Alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.  I know this is likely my fault, but I would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions.  A small deal for many device savvy people, but a challenge for me.","

The Echo is an incredible invention that often appears to be very intuitive. However, there have been times when I have asked for something that should be simple, yet I get no response. The installation process was not difficult, but I made some errors because I assumed I had completed a step when I had not. My suggestion is to be patient; the app will tell you when you can progress to the next stage. My current issue is that I have several Echo devices in my home and I would like to use them as intercoms, which I understand is possible. However, I can't make the Echo devices aware of each other. When I ask Alexa how to do this, she responds with instructions on how to change her name. I realise this is probably my own fault, but I would have expected the designers to anticipate this and make it easier to find the necessary instructions. It may not be a big deal for those who are tech-savvy, but it is proving to be a challenge for me."

The potential to control your home is an option I will explore more as I evolve my home into a ""smart home"". The voice recognition is very impressive. It is stylish and fun. I have no regrets with this purchase. It is great for technically changes people. Ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly.

If you want unlimited music control, be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your personal dj! You can even have conversations with the echo. I am not embarrassed to say, that echo has made me laugh a couple times when I ask it to tell me a joke. It tells me where my packages are since I am an amazon prime addict, it comes in extremely  handy!","

I will get the Echo hub and a few more Echo dots in the future.,"

We were ecstatic to get the Echo instead of a regular Bluetooth speaker. Alexa can do so much more than other non-smart speakers, and I'm especially fond of the timer feature; it's been useful for multi-tasking while cooking. I also use the Pandora integration every day.

It's extremely useful in simple things like spotify and audible and things like that but sometimes it doesn't answer everything I ask but it's still nice to use.,"

So I purchased one on prime day for my bathroom for when I’m getting ready for work. I listen to music at 4am and the base it’s metro booming.. Replacement for my clock radio, plus I have the echo dot on my night stand as my alarm clock..","

My 7 year old was given an Echo Dot as a birthday present from his dad and he loves it. It's great for homework and can answer any question you ask it. I decided to get one for my bathroom when I'm getting ready for work, and it's been a great replacement for my clock radio. I can listen to music at 4am and the bass is really loud.

I have had a blast using my Echo! It can do so much more than just give the weather, tell jokes, give news briefings, and play music. It's been a great value for the amount of entertainment it provides."

Be sure to employ this method often, particularly when speaking with children in different rooms of the house."
"Love it, still learning, makes a lot of things easier, like if you forget to turn a light off and your in another room all you do is ask Alexa to turn the light off.","

I love it; I'm still getting used to it, but it makes a lot of tasks easier. For example, if you forget to turn off a light and you're in another room, all you have to do is ask Alexa to turn it off."

"Once set up very user friendly. Set-up wasn't as user friendly as I'd hoped.. The alexa app should be able to download to a pc without installing [invasive ] drivers. My wife and I are both retired and she wouldn't have been able to install Alexa, but if my son wasn't supplying her with a smart phone we wouldn't be using Alexa yet.","

Setting up Alexa was not as straightforward as I had anticipated. My wife and I are both retired and she would not have been able to install it without help from our son. If he had not provided her with a smartphone, we would not be using Alexa yet. I wish that the Alexa app could be downloaded to a PC without having to install any intrusive drivers."

I used the product for my phone to look up the weather and watch videos,"

I employed the item for my phone to search for the weather and view videos."
"Don’t use it for much as I thought we would. Synced with Kasa-Cam and use it to check up on our baby in the crib a lot. Lyrics for music is cool, too. Other than that it’s used as a clock and standard dot’ish features.","

We haven't used it as much as we initially intended. However, we have connected it with Kasa-Cam to keep an eye on our little one in their crib. The lyrics for music is a great feature, and aside from that it is mainly used as a clock and for basic functions."
Amazing so far. Just got it the other day.,"

It's been incredible since I got it a few days ago."
"I like that it's smaller, but it has never understood commands as easily as our first-gen original Echo did.","

I appreciate the smaller size, but it doesn't seem to comprehend instructions as well as our initial Echo device."
"Worthy successor to the echo dot and right at home in the bed room as an alarm clock.  However, for the price it should come with the stand","

This device is a great alternative to the Echo Dot, perfect for use as an alarm clock in the bedroom. Nevertheless, considering the cost, it should include a stand."
"I love this device! All the functionality of an Amazon Echo with the added benefit of a video screen. It looks great on my nightstand as a clock (lots of faces to choose from) and displays weather, reminders, etc. I think it can do video calls too but I use FaceTime for that anyway. It’s a great shape and doesn’t take up a lot of room. I’m planning to get another one for my guest room. Awesome for a great price!","

I'm really impressed with this device! It has all the features of an Amazon Echo, plus a video screen. It looks great on my nightstand as a clock with lots of different faces to choose from, and it can show the weather, reminders, and more. I think it can even do video calls, though I prefer FaceTime for that. It's also small enough to fit in any room, so I'm planning to get another one for my guest room. It's a great value for the price!"
I love the Echo Spot. This bedside alarm clock size device can do what theEcho Show can do. I was concerned because I already had a large Echo in mybedroom that answered to “Alexa” like the other devices in my home. I wasconcerned about having both devices answering at the same time when I discoveredthat I had other name choices (not enough for me but just enough to avoid confusion).I named him “Echo.” Now if I could only choose a male voice. I loved that I could link it tomy security camera and my new doorbell. So many more features. Don’t forget to buy thestand/base. So many advantages to having that. Read the reviews. Highly recommend.,"

I was initially worried about having both the Echo Spot and the Echo Show in my bedroom, since they both respond to ""Alexa"", but I was relieved to find out I could give them different names. I named the Echo Spot ""Echo"". I'm still wishing I could give it a male voice, but I'm so happy I can link it to my security camera and doorbell. The stand/base for the Spot is definitely worth buying too. All in all, I'm really happy with the Echo Spot and I would highly recommend it to anyone."
"I love this little Spot more than I thought I would. The sound is great for such a little thing...my music plays nice and loud and clear. The video is terrific...I was watching some Prime shows just for the heck of it, and I was really impressed. Immediately convinced my mom to buy my sister one for her birthday!Only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars...I really wish it was cordless. I love having it in my kitchen but trying to find a place to plug it in is a pain. And it won’t connect to my Bluetooth speaker while playing Amazon Prime Music for some reason, which is a drag when I want to hear it in the dining room during dinner. Of course, if it was CORDLESS I could just bring it with me...otherwise, I absolutely love it and will probably buy another one!","

I am extremely fond of this little Spot and it has exceeded my expectations. The sound quality is great for such a small device and it plays my music at a decent volume with clarity. The video quality is also superb; I was watching some Prime shows and it blew me away. I was so impressed that I convinced my mom to purchase one for my sister's birthday. The only thing that stops me from giving it a full five stars is that it isn't cordless. It is great to have it in my kitchen but the hassle of finding a plug to connect it to is a nuisance. Additionally, it won't connect to my Bluetooth speaker while I am playing Amazon Prime Music in the dining room. If it was cordless, I could easily take it with me. Despite that, I really love it and may even buy another one."
"I bought on Prime Day and so glad I did. It’s easy to use and lots of customization options. I know some reviews said that the screen was small and hard to read, but I disagree.","

I took advantage of Prime Day and am really happy I did. It's user-friendly and has plenty of customization options. Although some reviews said the display was too tiny to see properly, I don't agree."
Honestly I like it but at the same time I don’t I could have bought a smaller one that did the exact same thing for less then half I bought it for the video chat and I have never really used it,"

I was initially attracted to this item, but I realize now that I could have purchased something similar for much less money. I only wanted it for video chat, but I haven't even used it for that."
"Overall it's great and I like that I can see lyrics and the time and  date. However, sometimes it freezes and doesn't respond properly--no error message about lack of connectivity--it just stops. Resetting resolves the problem.","

In general, I am pleased with the app since I can view lyrics and the time and date. Unfortunately, it occasionally freezes without displaying an error message about internet connection, and I have to reset it to fix the issue."
I love all that you can do with the Echo Spot!,"

I'm impressed by all the things you can do with the Echo Spot!"
The thing I like most about my Echo Spot is the voice command feature.  You can ask anything and get an answer or play any music without getting up to adjust the Echo. Easy to use,"

I really appreciate the voice command feature on my Echo Spot. It's so convenient to be able to ask questions and get answers or play music without having to move from my spot. It's user friendly and makes life so much simpler."
"Love it!! Perfect for an alarm clock replacement, plus so much more!!","

I'm absolutely in love with this product! It's perfect for replacing an alarm clock and it has so many other great features!"
"I love the Echo Spot as it is great for checking the weather along with many other things, but most important it works great as your alarm clock in your bedroom!","

I'm a huge fan of the Echo Spot because it's so useful for more than just checking the weather - it's also a fantastic alarm clock for your bedroom!"
We absolutely love this product!!! Wish we would have bought this instead of the dots!!!,"

We are absolutely enamored with this item! We wish we had bought this instead of the dots!"
"We like that we are able to get weather and other information quickly.  You can even hear music played. The speaker is clear.  We are enjoying it.  What we did not like because it was creepy was that the day before my husband played a particular song on our stereo for me.  The next day, I asked the Echo to play music from the same artist not specifying any particular song.  The Echo played the exact song by that same artist that my husband played on our stereo the day before.  It was a little disconcerting.","

We appreciate the convenience of being able to get weather and other information quickly, as well as hearing music played through the clear speaker. However, we were a bit unnerved when the Echo played the same song my husband had played on our stereo the day before, without us having asked for it specifically. It was a bit creepy."
"I like echo spot. I bought it to use as an alarm clock. One negative that i didnt really think about, when you wake up in the morning and are somewhat groggy, its hard to tell alexa to turn off the alarm, or hard to remember commands to snooze for a few minutes. In this case a clock with buttons seems to work better","

I purchased an Echo Spot to use as an alarm clock, but I didn't think about the fact that when I'm groggy in the morning, it can be difficult to remember commands to tell Alexa to turn off the alarm or snooze it. In this situation, a clock with buttons is more effective."
This is our second Echo Spot - to go with out two Echo Dots - love the look and how Alexia responds.,"

We recently purchased an Echo Spot to accompany the two Echo Dots we already owned - we are very pleased with the aesthetic and how Alexa responds."
Love my Echo Spot!,"

I am fond of my Echo Spot!"
It is very slow compared to the echo,"

The echo is much faster than it."
I love the way it is designed. And you have choices for the face.  I use it for my bed side.  I drop in; on my echo in another part of the house frequently without yelling.,"

I am a fan of the design, since it provides a lot of options for the face. I have it placed by my bedside, and I can easily access it from any room in the house without having to shout."
"Terrific sound for a small device, and nice form factor for the nightstand. I like the convenience of seeing the time and temperature rather than asking Alexa. Not using video much, but it would be nice if the device had a square/rectangular screen.","

The audio quality of this compact device is impressive, and its size is great for keeping on a nightstand. I appreciate the convenience of being able to quickly check the time and temperature without having to ask Alexa. Although I don't use video very often, I think it would be nice if the device had a square or rectangular display."
New to Alexa. Like this spot a lot.,"

I'm new to Alexa and I really enjoy this place."
"It's not perfect, but I really like this little gizmo. i bought it primarily for 2 purposes. First, so I could set wake-up alarms by individual days, and set the wake-up music individually by the day. Second, I wanted to control a bedroom light by voice, so I could shut it off as I was falling asleep, without having to get out of bed to turn a switch. The Echo Spot, together with a smart plug,has been able to accomplish that. A bonus has been getting Alexa to play music from my Amazon Prime playlists.What's not so great is that sometimes Alexa has a really hard time understanding instructions, and repeating and altering the way you say things can get pretty frustrating. Hopefully the AI gets better in the future, along with added functions.","

I'm really happy with this little gadget I bought; it does two things I wanted it to do. I can set alarms and music for different days of the week, and I can control a bedroom light with my voice, so I don't have to get up to turn the switch. The Echo Spot and a smart plug made this possible. I also get to listen to playlists from Amazon Prime, which is a nice bonus. The only downside is that Alexa sometimes has difficulty understanding instructions, and having to repeat and rephrase things can be annoying. Hopefully, the AI will improve and more features will be added in the future."
I love it.  It is so easy to use,"

I am fond of it. It is very user-friendly."
Put this on my night stand to use as a clock and alarm. Works great. Every morning I get the weather and news when I get up. Also reminds me of all the appointments my wife and I have.,"

I keep this clock and alarm on my night stand and it works really well. In the morning, I get up to the news and weather, plus it reminds me of our shared appointments."
Love it," or leave it

Take it or leave it"
"Part of it is my fault, I thought it could be wireless.  Though for the price, I still feel like it should be. Also the sound quality and volume could be better. I prefer the tap. Unless you really want to have the call options but today most of us have phones, computers or iPads. Just not worth it.","

I take some of the blame for expecting this to be wireless, especially considering the cost. Additionally, the sound and volume could be better. I would have been better off just using a tap. There's not much need for this product since most of us already have phones, computers, or iPads that can make calls. It's not worth it."
Very easy to use and much quicker then looking up everything on the cell phone.,"

It's extremely user-friendly and much faster than searching for information on a cell phone."

I am delighted with my new Echo Spot!"
"I love this clock, I just have to tell it to set my alarm.  No more fussing with buttons!","

Setting up was a breeze! I'm really enjoying it!"
"Simply amazing what a awsome device. It never ceases to amaze me, wake up to big bang music, go to sleep softly falling rain. Drop in on the kids and keep in touch. I have just scratched the surface as to what this devise can do.","

I am constantly astonished by this incredible device. I can wake up to the sounds of Big Bang, drift off to sleep with the sound of a gentle rain, and even stay in contact with my kids. I have only just begun to explore all the possibilities this device has to offer."
"I was skeptical at first but &#34;it&#34; grows on you.  It looks good, so far.  I did, however, turn off the camera.","

At first, I was doubtful, but I eventually came to like it. So far, it appears to be good. I did turn off the camera, though."
Sound quality is disappointing.,"

The audio is not up to par."
I love it!  I especially love that it is so small and does so much.  Got rid of my old CD/Alarm clock radio.  Much more room on nightstand.,"

I am absolutely delighted with it! I am particularly fond of the fact that it is so tiny yet has so many features. I no longer need my cumbersome CD/Alarm clock radio, freeing up more space on my bedside table."
Great sound and video plus all the great stuff that Alexa has to offer even turns my lights on and off,"

I am impressed by the amazing audio and video quality, as well as all of the amazing features that Alexa has to offer--including the ability to turn my lights on and off."
The ease to use product,"

The product is user-friendly."
"So far pretty happy with the Spot. For me it really is a glorified alarm clock/radio and I know I could have something more cost effective but eh, I like it. I had read the reviews about the scrolling issues and saw the one about how to make that stop and it did. So far so good.","

I'm quite pleased with my Spot. It's essentially an alarm clock/radio, and I could have gotten something cheaper, but I wanted this one. I read reviews about the scrolling problem and found a solution that worked. So far, everything's been great."
"I am just entering the &#34;smart&#34; technology world. I haven't figured it all out yet, but so far it's pretty cool!","

I'm new to the world of ""smart"" technology and I'm still trying to figure it out, but it's been really exciting so far!"
"It was smaller than I had anticipated, and when I say that I very much mean it. However, it still works very well! Quality sound, easily programmed, easy to work with, but Alexa is not anywhere as good as other voice programs.","

I didn't expect it to be so small, and I'm not exaggerating. Despite its size, it still functions really well! The sound quality is great and it's easy to program and use. Unfortunately, Alexa can't compare to other voice programs."

"i had a couple of echo dots previously - bought these _SPECIFICALLY_ for the Ring doorbell video / cloud cam display / interface capabilities. WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED. Love the fact that I can ask to see front yard / back yard / front door, etc.the video chat with the other rooms is also quite cool.BONUS: “Alexa show me Ant Man trailer, etc”i know this can all be done on laptop/desktop, but it’s cool now having an ‘appliance’ that’s always just there, and it doesn’t interrupt what i’m doing.","

I had purchased a couple of Echo Dots specifically for the Ring Doorbell Video, Cloud Cam display and interface capabilities, and I am pleased with the results. I love being able to ask to see the front yard, back yard, and front door. Additionally, the video chat feature with other rooms is awesome. As a bonus, I can even ask Alexa to show me the Ant Man trailer. Although I could do all of this on my laptop or desktop, it's great to have an appliance that is always ready and doesn't interrupt whatever I'm doing."
"Bought this for my bedroom and the Show for my living room. Love them both. The Spot is perfect for bedside and has an impressive design. Shows lyrics, photos , etc. I paired it with a Smart Plug for the bedroom lamps &#34;Alexa, turn off lights&#34;, love it.","

I purchased this item for my bedroom and the Show for my living room and I am very pleased with them both. The Spot is ideal for a bedside table and has a stunning design, displaying lyrics, pictures, and more. I also connected it to a Smart Plug for the bedroom lamps, so I can say ""Alexa, turn off the lights"" and love it."
Love that is can do so much! It sits on my nightstand! Only improvements I would make is having battery back up capability and the screen could be a tad bigger. But overall I’m happy I have it! Would recommend!,"

I'm really pleased with the love that this item can provide. It looks great on my nightstand! The only things I would change is if it had a battery backup and the screen was a bit bigger. But overall, I'm very satisfied and I would definitely recommend it!"

The present was much appreciated and the person who received it absolutely adored it!"
"Cool little piece of tech...we’re still learning some of its functions and possibilities, but I can see some potential.  Even my ‘technically challenged’ wife already figured out how to video call our daughter.","

This nifty piece of technology is still being explored for its capabilities and potential. Even my wife, who isn't tech savvy, was able to figure out how to video chat with our daughter."
"I have been extremely impressed with the device as a whole. Completely changed sleep schedule and replaced my alarm clock. It is the perfect bedside counter device - alarm, wake up music, weather, top news stories, etc. Perfect device for what I wanted and does so much more than I expected it to do, calling feature is also a huge selling point. This is a must own item. Probably will grab more Echos in the future.","

I am thoroughly impressed with this device. It has completely altered my sleep pattern and I no longer need an alarm clock. It is the ideal bedside companion - it has an alarm, soothing music to wake up to, weather information, the latest news, and more. I was not expecting it to do so much, and the calling feature is an added bonus. I highly recommend this product and I may even buy more Echos in the future."
"As an Alexa device, it works just as well as any of the other products.  Unfortunately it doesn't go up from there.  The ability to play videos is very limited.  You CAN NOT play YouTube and when you can play a video the cropping of the screen makes it look very strange. There is quite a selection of clock faces, and you can control what is displays with one glaring and VERY ANNOYING exception.  You can't turn off the &#34;Things to try&#34; screen You can turn off the screen scroll, but that defeats the purpose of having the screen.  I don't need to be reminded every 5 seconds what things I can do with Alexa.  I don't need the advertising, especially at the cost of this device.  Overall, its an expensive Alexa device with a screen that's not very useful and annoying.  I would not recommend this until the Amazon people get their act together and come up with a screen that's actually useful.","

Although this Alexa device works as well as any other product, it does not offer much more than that. It does not support YouTube, and when you can play a video, the cropping of the screen makes the visuals look strange. There is a decent selection of clock faces, and you can control what is displayed with one major and very irritating exception: you can't turn off the ""Things to try"" page. You can turn off the screen scroll, but this defeats the purpose of having the screen in the first place. It is unnecessary to be reminded every five seconds of the things you can do with Alexa, and the device's cost does not justify the advertising. All in all, this is an expensive Alexa device with a screen that is not very useful and is incredibly annoying. I would not recommend this until Amazon improves the screen and makes it actually useful."
So far so good.,"

Everything is going well up to this point."
"This device is perfect for a smart nightstand clock. I love how it dims based on the ambient light in the room. Its the first nightstand clock I have had in my bedroom in years because the lighting and glow from typical alarm clocks bother me when trying to sleep. The screen on this dims when the lights in the room go out and is not bothersome at all.Overall a great addition to my smart home. Its nice to be able to tell Alexa to turn on/off the bedroom lights without even getting out of bed or reaching for your phone. I have a bunch of other Alexa devices, but this was the first one with a screen.","

This device is ideal for a smart nightstand clock. I'm delighted that it automatically adjusts its brightness based on the amount of light in the room. It's been a long time since I had a nightstand clock in my bedroom, since the light and glow from conventional alarm clocks was too disruptive when I was trying to sleep. The display on this device dims when the lights in the room are switched off and doesn't disturb me at all. All in all, it's a great addition to my smart home. It's so convenient to be able to tell Alexa to turn on or off the bedroom lights without having to get out of bed or take my phone. I have a lot of other Alexa gadgets, but this was the first one with a screen."
"I love this thing. I talk to it through walls and in other rooms. I have been an amazon lover for a while so I have amazon music unlimited, kindle unlimited, prime video, etc., so I was ready for this when it came out. The screen is just so nice to have.The only thing resembling a down side is that it doesn't always perfectly understand which song I want to hear, but I do have a deep southern accent, lower Alabama, so I don't speak English anyways.","

I have been an Amazon fan for some time now and have all the associated services like Amazon Music Unlimited, Kindle Unlimited and Prime Video, so I was prepared for this when it was released. I adore this device and am able to communicate with it through walls and other rooms. The screen is amazing, but the only downside is that it doesn't always understand me properly due to my deep southern accent from lower Alabama."
Smaller than I thought it would be. Happy I got a stand so it sits up higher on the bedside table.,"

It's not as big as I anticipated, so I'm glad I got a stand to elevate it on the nightstand."
Echo Spot works well except it does not work with the Ring doorbell as it states on the website. Since they were sold as a pair I thought that it would be app ready.  Unfortunately that is not case.  Perhaps Ring will update so that they can be integrated.,"

The Echo Spot performs well in general, however it is not compatible with the Ring doorbell as advertised on the website. This was disappointing, as they were marketed as a pair, leading me to believe that they would be app-ready. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Hopefully, Ring will make changes to their product so that the two can be integrated."

"We've owned a number of Echo devices, but have viewed them as more of a toy than a tool.  Other than playing music through a sound system, we haven't found much use for them.  We just don't find the voice user interface to be all that efficient.  The Echo Spot solves the efficiency problem by displaying the information that you're routinely interested in.  Furthermore, you can do some basic navigation using the touch screen as well as tailor the settings.  We now use these as bedside clocks.","

We have had several Echo gadgets in the past, but we saw them more as a plaything than a useful device. Apart from playing music, we haven't found much use for them as the voice user interface was not very efficient. However, the Echo Spot has solved this problem by providing a display of the data you are interested in, along with the capability to use the touch screen for basic navigation and customizing settings. We now use them as alarm clocks near our beds."
I love my Echo Spot.  Waking to my favorite music.  Being able to completely turn off display at night so my bedroom is dark.  All the skills I have yet to try.  Easy to use.,"

I adore my Echo Spot. Having my favorite tunes greet me in the morning is a treat. I appreciate that I can switch off the display in the evening to keep my bedroom dark. There are lots of skills I'm yet to explore, and it's all so easy to use."
"I like how small it is, but I’m still able to see my Ring cameras.","

I appreciate the compact size, yet I still have a clear view of my Ring cameras."

"I am a hardcore fan of Echo. Infact I am in love with all members of my Alexa family. I have Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Plus and now this new toddler Echo Spot. Every variant has its own beauty. I love feel and size of Echo Spot. It’s fabulous as far as looks are concerned. It does not have great Audio quality (which I did not expect at the time of placing order because of its compact and small size). I bought it to connect with my Bose SoundTouch.","

"Works great as a bedside clock but the microphone for Alexa doesn't work as well as the normal Echo.  Sometimes Alexa doesn't hear me when I try to interrupt her it to give new instructions.  The speaker also isn't as good as the normal Echo.  Screen is small so not really useful for viewing any type of video or for seeing who's at the front door.  But, it's great for the bedside.","

This clock is great for using at the bedside, however, the microphone for Alexa doesn't work as well as the standard Echo. It can be difficult to interrupt Alexa with new instructions, and the speaker isn't as good either. The small screen isn't suitable for viewing videos or seeing who is at the door, but it's still a great addition to the bedside."

I can use my phone, or ask Alexa, to switch things on and off with this device, plus its smart plugins and the Alex app. Additionally, I can use it to order items, look up information, watch videos, check the weather, set alarms, and make video calls - the possibilities are endless!"

"In a matter of minutes it became indispensable addition to our house. Extrimelly useful hub of information, music, automation, communication, and assistant in basic needs. Would love to have a voice personalization. Some things are better not to said aloud but typed (like door unlocking codes) but that is problem of unwitty developers. So far only positive experience. The privacy invasions is happened way before Alexa, it is on your phone no matter brand or carrier. To Alexa defence at list it has a button to turn a microphone off.","

It only took a few minutes for Alexa to become an invaluable part of our home. It is an incredibly useful source of knowledge, music, automation, communication and can help with basic needs. I would love to be able to personalize the voice. Some things are better not typed out loud, like door unlocking codes, but that is an issue with the developers. So far my experience has been positive. Privacy invasions have been happening long before Alexa; it is on your phone no matter the brand or carrier. To defend Alexa, at least it has a button to turn off the microphone."
"I love this device! It's so great. What a great alarm clock and what a surprisingly good speaker! Only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because it needs to have a few more features like playing YouTube videos, and Google play music. The camera is not very good in low light if you decide to drop in and it's dark in the room.Other than those minor things, I love it. Great buy and would buy again","

I absolutely adore this device! It's amazing! It's a great alarm clock and it has a surprisingly good speaker. The only thing that kept me from giving it five stars is that it could use a few more features like playing YouTube videos and Google Play Music. The camera isn't the best in dim lighting, so if you come in when it's dark in the room, it won't be very good. Despite those minor flaws, I still love it. It's an awesome purchase and I would buy it again."

"It has been able to interpret my instructions pretty well right from the start, even from a distance. A lot of the skills are excellent. I've added a few of the late shows to my flash briefing but it's ridiculous that it can't access YouTube.It might be important to note that adding an event to your calendar is a task; it seems to have difficulty with the time span of an event. I imagine this is a functionality people would use often.","

From the beginning, the device was able to accurately understand my commands, even from far away. It has many great features. I have added some recent shows to my flash briefing, but it is a bit disappointing that it can't access YouTube. It is worth noting that scheduling an event is a task that it struggles with, especially when it comes to the length of the event. This is something that people would likely use frequently."

I strongly suggest purchasing the stand that goes with this amazing product; it will make it fit better on the desk."
Eh it’s cool and all but also kinda boring I don’t really know what to do with it other than it being a desk clock so 3/5 is about right. I can’t connect to my Spotify unless it’s premium and I’m in college and I’m not paying or that or amazon music so,"

It's okay, but it's a bit dull. I'm not sure what to do with it other than using it as a desk clock, so I'd give it a 3 out of 5 rating. Unfortunately, I can't connect it to my Spotify account since I'm a college student and don't have a premium subscription or Amazon Music."
I am huge Amazon fan! First to have a kindle and the echo. I waited a bit on this but have wanted it for awhile. I do love it!! My kids love it! They love watching videos and the lyrics to the songs. Now the video calling feature is nothing like how the advertisement made it out. I thought as long as someone would FaceTime me I could do it through that and I can’t. It’s Spot to Spot. Can’t even Skype (which I do often with my aunt). The is my major disappointment with it.,"

I'm such a big admirer of Amazon! I was the first one to have a Kindle and the Echo. Even though I waited a while to get them, I had wanted them for a long time. I really appreciate them, and my kids do too. They love watching videos and singing along to the songs. However, the video calling feature isn't as great as the commercials portrayed it to be. I had assumed that as long as someone could FaceTime me, I could do it through that, but I can't. It's only Spot to Spot, and I can't even use Skype (which I use frequently to talk to my aunt). This is what I'm most disappointed with."
LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE. The only think I notice is that it doesn't pick-up my voice and commands as well as my Echo and Echo Dots (we have 4 Echo products throughout our house). I have this in the kitchen and in my bedroom as my alarm clock. I'm no longer searching for a pen and paper to make lists!!!!,"

I never expected to get an Alexa device, but it's perfect for my home office. The screen is what makes it worth the extra cost compared to other Alexa devices, as it can show lyrics of songs, play my XM radio, and display videos of movie trailers and news. It's great!"
I love it.  I made a group with my echo dot so I get music through my home.  I am waiting for the to go on sale again so hopefully I can get another spot for my bedroom..  I love the alarm and weather at the sound of my voice..,"

"When we first received this product, it was great.  However, about a week ago, the device served up a video advertisement around 10:30pm at night and scared myself and my family.  If you want to make sure you are protected and don't allow video directly in your home, the spot is not a device that can keep you safe.","

When we initially got this product, it was great. Unfortunately, a few days ago, it showed a video ad late at night and it frightened me and my family.

"I got my Echo Spot on Prime Day and love it. I think it still is a little expensive, but the chance to save $30 convinced me to buy it. I basically use it as a radio alarm clock because on my old radio the stations would sometimes not come in clearly. I also like the sleep sounds skill, and hearing the weather. I'm still exploring the other skills...just discovered some Star Trek sounds (Alexa, beam me up) which are fun!","

I decided to purchase my Echo Spot on Prime Day after the chance to save $30 made it more appealing. I primarily use it as an alarm clock since my previous radio had poor reception.

"I don't know why I like it, but I do. It's like an all-in-one alarm clock.  If you have other alexa devices, you know what it is.  If you are looking to get an alarm clock, this is the one to get (yes, its much more than that).  It shows you the time, it shows you the weather, its touch screen, it shows you music lyrics, and it does all the things your typical alexa device does.  It's quite loud for its size as well (sound way better than echo dot).  It also does video calling, which is pretty awesome.  The viewing angle is great, so even if its sitting fairly high up, you can still see the display well enough.","

I'm not sure why I'm so drawn to this all-in-one alarm clock, but I am. If you already have Alexa devices, you know what it can do. If you're looking for an alarm clock, this is the one to get; it does so much more than just keep time. It can show you the time, the weather, music lyrics, and all the other things Alexa devices do, and it's louder than an Echo Dot. It even has video calling capabilities, and the viewing angle is great, so you can see the display clearly even if it's placed high up."

Great device,"

I’m a fan of echo devices. I think it’s a great alternative to a clean clock. I like using it to adjust the lightning in the room and listening to sounds to help sleep. My two year old sleeps so much better with it on. We also use it to tell my two year old stories. Only issue is the volume of alexa speaking when you tell her to turn off the lights is loud when the volume is set to what you want to listen to the music at night,".

I'm a big supporter of Echo devices. I think they are a great substitute for a traditional alarm clock. I love using it to adjust the lighting in the room and listen to soothing sounds to help me sleep. My two year old sleeps much better with it on. We also use it to tell my two year old stories. The only issue is that Alexa's volume is quite loud when you tell her to turn off the lights and it is set to the volume you need to listen to music at night."
"I own 5 Echo devices, consider me addicted! This little number is awesome, not only do I like that it displays, the sound is great and it has the same dependable functionality as other Echo devices. One feature I really like is how it slowly dims after I turn off my bedroom light, so I have a night light for a bit. I love Echo devices and have just about run out of places to put them!","

I am totally hooked on my five Echo devices! They are amazing - not only do they look great, they have great sound quality and always work perfectly. My favourite feature is that when I turn off my bedroom light, it gradually dims, giving me a night light for a while. I love Echo devices so much that I have run out of places to put them!"
I enjoy this little thing a lot.  Will do almost anything.  I like the jokes it tells.  I’m still learning different functions,".

I'm really fond of this item and I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make it work. I find the humor it provides very amusing and I'm still discovering its different capabilities."

we like it. very convenient,"

We are fond of it. It is highly convenient."
I love the size of the echo spot. It fits on my nightstand but has all of the capabilities of my echo show. I like going to sleep with the lightening storm. The images along with the sounds are very relaxing. The calling and messaging feature is great. It’s small enough to take with when we travel. I love and own most of the Alexa products. Our whole family uses them.,"

I am a big fan of the Echo Spot because of its size; it easily fits on my nightstand, yet it still has all the features of the larger Echo Show. I find the lightning storm visuals and sounds to be very calming when I'm trying to sleep, and I appreciate the calling and messaging capabilities. Additionally, it is small enough that I can take it with me when I travel. All in all, I am a huge supporter of all the Alexa products, and my family uses them all."
The amazon Alexa is so nice to have she wakes me up in the morning with alarms and is great if you have prime because she can do a lot more plays any songs you want her to play and she can even make playlists of your favorite songs i love the Alexa because she has games you can play ad you can watch videos or movie trailers on the screen!,"

I really enjoy having an Amazon Alexa around because she wakes me up in the morning with alarms and has a lot of extra features if you have Prime. I can ask her to play any song I want and she can even make playlists of my favorite tunes. Additionally, she has games I can play and I can watch videos or movie trailers on the screen. Altogether, I love my Alexa!"

"This product currently has two related software flaws that make it completely unusable:1) There is a &#34;card&#34; on the homescreen called &#34;Things To Try&#34; -- it's an ad for other Alexa services you can try. You can turn off all the other homescreen cards, but not this one.2) By default, the homescreen cards &#34;cycle&#34; automatically, which is incredibly annoying. There is a setting where you can opt to have the cards only &#34;cycle once&#34; instead of &#34;cycle continuously&#34;, but critically *this setting does not work*. My unit has been set to &#34;cycle once&#34;, and the cards still continue to cycle all the time. Have rebooted the device, re-set, etc etc.Until these two obvious software issues are fixed, in my opinion the product is useless.","

This product has two major software issues that make it unusable: 1) There is a ""card"" on the homescreen called ""Things To Try"" that advertises other Alexa services you can use. You cannot turn off this card. 2) The homescreen cards are set to ""cycle continuously"" by default, which is very aggravating. There is an option to switch to ""cycle once"" instead, however, this setting does not work. Even after rebooting the device and resetting it, the cards continue to cycle all the time. Until these two software problems are resolved, the product is not functional."

I bought this during Prime Day and I'm really enjoying it! I had the Echo Dot on my bedside table, but I really wanted something with a screen. This is perfect and the sound quality is really good."
"Yes it met my expectations.  The snooze on the alarm needs a but of work.  Tap it and it snoozes, swipe up and it prompts you to dismiss.  But without my glasses I can't read it and often it just snoozes.  Then one day I must have dismissed tomorrow's alarm because it never went off.  I have it set for Mon-Thu.  Fri I don't need to get up early.  A more apparent indicator of the alarm set would be nice.  My old alarm had a red light.","

The alarm met my expectations, however, the snooze feature needs improvement. It requires me to tap it or swipe up to snooze or dismiss, but I can't read it without my glasses. One day, I must have dismissed the alarm for the next day, because it didn't go off even though I have it set for Monday through Thursday. On Fridays, I don't need to wake up early. It would be helpful if there was a more obvious indicator of the alarm being set, like my old alarm had with a red light."

I'm a fan of this product, and I'm particularly fond of the display on the alarm clock."
"Such a fun, easy, and convenient device to have around the house. No need to pick up my phone to look something up, just a few words and the world is at your fingertips. The speaker puts off great sound and the screen is crisp. The price is right for a device like this.","

Having this device at home is so enjoyable, effortless, and convenient. I don't need to grab my phone to search for something; all I need to do is say a few words and the information I want is instantly available. Additionally, the sound quality is fantastic and the display is clear. The cost of this device is very reasonable."
"A great replacement for the bedside alarm clock, which had a funny habit of going off at 12am every time the cleaning ladies came through. We mostly use it to turn the ceiling fan lights on and off, while leaving the fan running. Only gripe would be the mic sensitivity, which doesn't appear be as good as the View or Gen2. It can get a little frustrating having to repeat yourself.","

An alternative to the bedside alarm clock, which had a tendency to sound at midnight when the cleaning staff arrived, is being used to switch the lights of the ceiling fan on and off while keeping the fan running. The only issue we have is that the microphone sensitivity isn't as high as the View or Gen2, making it difficult to get the command heard without having to repeat it."
This product has made my life much simpler with a little one. I use it a lot for music and when i have my hands full turning it on/off or up/down is a breeze. The screen is a great novelty where i can watch the news!,"

This product has made parenting easier with a young child. I use it frequently for listening to music, and it's incredibly easy to control the volume or turn it on/off when I'm busy. Plus, the screen is a great bonus, allowing me to watch the news!"

I was a bit hesitant to incorporate ""smart technology"" into my home, but now I'm a total convert! I'm really impressed with the Echo Spot's modern design and how quickly I was able to get it up and running.

Love it getting use to it and Alexa is getting use to my voice . Sometimes she doesn't answer but I think it has to do when internet is low or is updating or my voice isn't strong. Over all I haven't had any of the annoying stuff that everyone is complaining about. Thank goodness I didn't listen to those reviews.  And paid attention to the Apple guy .,"

I'm getting more and more comfortable with Alexa and she's getting used to my voice.

I'm glad I didn't pay attention to the reviews and just listened to the Apple guy."

Alexa wakes me up every morning for work, playing whatever station I choose from Iheart Radio or Spotify. With the addition of smart home devices, she'll be even more helpful to me!

"I purchased this on prime day mostly as a present for myself because I found having the echo plus on my kitchen counter to be overwhelming when cooking, cutting, cleaning, etc. especially when our counters aren’t very wide to begin with. After going back and forth between this and the show I decided on this because I felt it had all the same features but is more compact. I can honestly say I have no regrets. While I probably wouldn’t watch a movie I’d been dying to see on this, it’s a great way to listen to music, watch a quick YouTube video, etc. I even attempted watching “Jaws” on this and while it wasn’t the most comfortable thing for my eyes to do, it wasn’t as bad as one would think. I would definitely recommend!","

I bought this item on Prime Day mostly for myself as a present, since I felt the Echo Plus on my kitchen counter was too much when I was cooking, cutting, and cleaning, especially since my counter space isn't very big. After weighing the pros and cons of the Echo Plus and the Show, I chose this one because it has all the same features, but it's more compact. I'm really happy with my choice; I wouldn't watch a movie I've been dying to see on this, but it's good for listening to music, watching a brief YouTube video, and even watching something like ""Jaws"" (although it wasn't the most comfortable thing for my eyes). I would definitely suggest this product."

Yes you can have it scroll once, and just stay on the clock, but I like having other cards as well. God its the worst and SO irritating.  I got it super cheap, so i just face the screen toward the wall and treat it like a Dot instead of a Spot.  What a dumb move on Amazons​ part.","

I'm giving this product five stars, but it's so annoying that every time I try to scroll through the face cards, this stupid ""Try and ask Alexa"" suggestion pops up. I would like to be able to scroll through the cards multiple times, but I can't. It's so infuriating. I got it for a good price, so I just turn the screen towards the wall and use it like a Dot instead of a Spot. Amazon really messed up on this one."
"Love that I have command access to news such as Bloomberg TV, NPR, etc.Highly recommend that you gain access to Alexa app before setting up Device and get familiar with key features/services...such as setting up your daily commute.If family and friends have Spot...then it’s a great substitute for Skype and Face Time...you can always “drop in” when missing loved ones or just to catch up.","

I strongly suggest that you get the Alexa app before setting up your device and become acquainted with its various features and services, like setting up your daily commute. If your family and friends have the Spot device, it can be a great alternative to Skype or FaceTime, allowing you to ""drop in"" and keep in touch with those you care about. Additionally, I'm grateful to have access to news sources such as Bloomberg TV and NPR."

I have two speakers: one in my computer room and the other that I can take outside onto the deck. Although it's not ideal for watching videos, it can still be done.

It does everything short of clean your house... which, when I asked Alexa to clean my house.... was told she didn’t have hands, but instead played a fantastic playlist for cleaning!  From reading books to my five year old, to video chat, to silly selfies, music that automatically goes to my Bose Bluetooth speaker, setting timers, alarms, changing my thermostat on voice command, tells me the weather, sends hubby a grocery pick up list, and I am sure. Million more things!BUY IT.....you u will not regret it.","

I'm usually not very easily impressed by electronic gadgets, but this one is like nothing I've ever seen before. It does almost anything you could ask for, except for cleaning your house - which I did ask Alexa to do, and she responded with a really great playlist for cleaning! From reading stories to my 5-year-old to video chatting, taking fun selfies, streaming music to my Bose Bluetooth speaker, setting timers and alarms, adjusting my thermostat with voice commands, giving me the weather forecast, sending my husband a grocery list, and so much more - I highly recommend this product, you won't regret it!"

"Great product EXCEPT there is no possible way for it to act as a clock the displays the time PERMANENTLY.  When in 'Clock' mode, the screen rotates between the clock face and a 'Things to Try' screen.  I intended on buying several units for my house, but I do not need a screen in the house that is permanently trying to upset me.  Acting as clock should be a BASIC feature of the Echo Spot.  How could you get this wrong, Amazon??  #FAIL","

This product is great, except for its lack of a basic feature: the ability to permanently display the time. Instead, when in 'Clock' mode, the screen alternates between the clock face and a 'Things to Try' screen.

"All is fine with the Spot exact for one massive failing.  In order to turn off a repeating alarm in the morning you pretty much have to talk - which is not a thing you usually want to do when first woken up and your bed partner will definitely not like.  YES, you can manually swipe up on the alarm face to dismiss but i) swiping up rather than touching screen when you are half asleep is very difficult and results in setting snooze more than half the time even if you really try to swipe to dismiss and ii) if you do manage to swipe up to dismiss, then you completely delete your recurring alarm.This is especially annoying as Amazon could so easily fix this by simply making touching the screen turn off the alarm but NOT delete it or at least make it a setting to decide whether touching the screen for a recurring alarm snoozes or turns it off.  But as the clock has been out for a year now and they still haven't adding this setting, clearly not going to happen.  This may be the biggest product design screw up Amazon has ever made.","

Everything is great with the Spot except for one major flaw. It is not possible to turn off a repeating alarm in the morning without speaking, which is not something you'd want to do when you first wake up, and it would definitely not be appreciated by your bed partner. It is possible to manually swipe up on the alarm face to dismiss it, but this is difficult to do when you are half asleep, and you end up snoozing it more often than not, even if you try to swipe to dismiss it. Furthermore, if you do manage to swipe up to dismiss it, then you completely delete your recurring alarm. This is particularly frustrating, as Amazon could easily fix this by making it so that touching the screen turns off the alarm without deleting it, or at least make it a setting to decide whether touching the screen for a recurring alarm snoozes or turns it off. However, since the clock has been out for a year now and they still haven't added this setting, it doesn't seem like it's going to happen. This could be one of the biggest product design mistakes Amazon has ever made."

"For as awesome as the Echo and Echo Dots are, the Spot is a disappointment. There is very little control over what the screen shows, what the clock looks like, what order things show up in, etc. At this point if I hadn't thrown the box away immediately, I would have sent it back and just got another full size Echo.","

The Echo and Echo Dots are great, but the Spot has been a letdown. There is limited customization of the screen, clock, and other features. If I hadn't already thrown away the box, I would have returned it and just bought another regular Echo."

"Can’t be used as a baby monitor which is why I had purchased it.  I didn’t realize this until I read the reviews on the Alexa skill for syncing the Nest Cam.  Considering all of the poor reviews and the fact that it should be simple to fix, surprised Amazon hasn’t upgraded the software to allow more than 39 minutes of viewing or alerts like you get on the Nest app.","

I was unaware that the Alexa skill for syncing the Nest Cam could not be used as a baby monitor when I bought it, which I found out after reading the reviews. It seems like a relatively easy fix, so I'm surprised Amazon hasn't upgraded the software to allow for more than 39 minutes of viewing or to provide alerts like you get on the Nest app."
"Would be 5 stars if you could turn off the &#34;Things to Try&#34; screen!!!  I should have read up on this before buying the Spot.  Amazon, please update to enable us to turn this off!  It is SO extremely annoying to look over to see the time but instead see &#34;Things to try&#34;.","

I wish I had done more research before purchasing the Spot because if the ""Things to Try"" screen could be turned off, I would have given it five stars.

"I own 3 of these...  amazon is ignoring its customers and using these devices as a marketing tool.  You can customize the screen contents, but you cannot turn off there advertising, Things to Try...  People will suggest that you can, but you can only do so if you turn off all content changes which is not an acceptable option.Moreover, they should increase the size slightly, and improve the audio speaker.  That would give you a 5 star device.Right now i’m debating whether to return all 3 devices.  My wife says we should.","

I have 3 of these gadgets, and it seems like Amazon is taking advantage of its customers by utilizing them as a way to advertise. You can modify the display, but you cannot disable their ads, and even though people may say you can, the only way to do so is to turn off all content changes, which isn't an option. Additionally, they should make the size a bit bigger and enhance the audio speaker for a 5 star device. I'm currently deliberating whether I should return all 3 of these devices, and my wife thinks we should."
"I never thought I was going to be THAT person that is completely connected. I purchased this and another Echo product on Prime Day and fell in love.  I have one in my office and one in our kitchen.  I have already used this for morning briefings from the News while I am getting ready for the day as well as look up recipes.  The screen is big enough for me to easily read writing (this was a concern for me).  I loved this so much I purchased it for my grandparents and parents so they can easily video call me as they tend to have issues with their computer and other video conferencing tools.  Note: I did purchase camera covers (even though there is a button to &#34;turn off the camera and microphone&#34; and it doesn't impede the operations and camera so if that is what you are worried about, there are work around!","

I never expected to become so tech-savvy, but after buying some Echo products on Prime Day, I was hooked. I now have one in my office and one in the kitchen, and I use it for everything from hearing the morning news while I'm getting ready, to looking up recipes. The screen size was a concern of mine, but it's big enough for me to easily read. I was so impressed with the product that I bought one for my grandparents and parents, who often have difficulty with computers and video conferencing. As a precaution, I purchased camera covers, but there's also the option to turn off the camera and microphone, which doesn't interfere with the device's operation."

You're going to have to shell out an extra $20 bucks for the stand that should come with it so you can angle it best for how ever you are using this. My biggest gripe. I already spent an arm and a leg on this it should come with the stand.,"

"Love it except that Amazon needs a reference one cohesive link for a full user manual. I don't have hours to research websites. Plus, more instruction from Alexa on skills would be great. We often get the answer, ""I don't know that skill"" even though I've added it in the app. I.e. Kwikset or Pizza Hut.","

I really enjoy using Amazon, but it would be helpful if there was one clear link for a comprehensive user manual. I don't have time to look through multiple websites, and I wish Alexa had more direction on how to use certain skills. For example, when I try to use Kwikset or Pizza Hut, I often get the response ""I don't know that skill"" even though I have set it up in the app."

"I got this on Prime day and figured I'd see what all the hype is about.  Honestly I didn't really want to like it as personally bugging my house seems kinda weird, but honestly, I love it.  Like it or not this is the way the world is going, so why not.I loved it so much I ordered 2.  I didn't get the Show because it looks like it came from the 1990's and is downright ugly.  I have no interest on watching anything on these devices anyway, so the Spot's screen does not bother me - although it is very clear.Alexa can hear you from pretty much everywhere.  My favorite part about this is having it in our living room where it's hooked up to our bluetooth soundbar - where I can just say play any song I want and it will.  I guess I could just pick up my smartphone to do that, but you don't know how much easier it is to interact with media using your voice rather than navigating through multiple pages.The one thing that I am not a fan of is the home screen cards do not really rotate that much - they also do not rotate when playing music.  I'd love for it to display the weather as I listen to music.The screen is clear and I also really enjoy Alexa being able to tell me how my commute will be - there is a great skill that you can download that will tell you traffic to 5 different places (that you program and name) so you can say alexa give me traffic to my parents - and she will tell you the best route and time you will arrive in current traffic.  I have this programmed for my parents, fiances parents, work, and her work.  So it really works great.The one thing that I actually preferred the Dot over the Spot is the dot will light up different colors when you have package notifications.. I have not seen the Spot really do much for package notifications yet.  The dot it was very easy to tell when something was delivered.  I would recommend Amazon do exactly what they did for the Dot but on the Spot - the Dot lights up colors - why can't the Spot ?  The same way you command alexa and you get that blue ring, just make that ring yellow when a package is updated for delivery.Overall it's a great device that I am looking forward to integrating my home around.  I'm already looking at dash buttons, smart plugs, etc..- and = when I become a home owner instead of renting where I can't tinker with my thermostat I will be purchasing a Nest down the road for HVAC integration.","I got this on Prime Day and wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I wasn't sure if I'd like it, as I felt a bit strange about having a device in my house that could be listening to me, but I ended up loving it. It's clear that this is the way the world is moving, so why not get on board? I was so impressed that I even bought two of them. I didn't go for the Show as it looks like something from the 90s and is really ugly. I don't watch anything on these devices anyway, so the Spot's screen doesn't bother me. Alexa can hear you from almost anywhere in the house, and my favorite thing is having it hooked up to our Bluetooth soundbar so I can just ask it to play any song I want. It's much easier than searching through multiple pages on my phone. The one downside is that the home screen cards don't rotate much, and they stay the same even when music is playing. I'd love it if it showed the weather when I'm listening to music. I actually preferred the Dot over the Spot for package notifications, as the Dot lights up in different colors when something is delivered. I haven't seen the Spot do anything like that yet. I'd recommend Amazon make the Spot do the same thing the Dot does - have a yellow ring when a package is on its way. All in all, I'm really looking forward to integrating my home with this device. I'm already looking at Dash buttons, smart plugs, etc. and when I become a homeowner, I'll be getting a Nest for HVAC integration."
"The screen response time is way better than I expected. Sound quality is good too, also it’s not so bright that I have to turn off the screen but it is an option.  I have a Dot in another room and which ever hears me better is the one that responds.","

The reaction time of the display is much better than what I anticipated. The sound quality is also great, and it's not too bright that I need to turn off the screen, but I can if I want to. I have another Dot in another room and whichever one is able to pick up my voice better is the one that will respond."

"I bought this to replace a Dot in my bedroom. Already have a Show and a couple of full-sized Echo units in my house.The Spot is okay for what it is. Two issues, one minor and one major:-the minor one - why include the huge bezel on the front? Why not take that space and make the display larger? A total waste of usable space.-the major one, also involves the Show: I'm very used to these devices. I don't need to see &#34;Things to Try&#34; whenever I use a voice command with it (even setting it to rotate once starts this crap over again when you dare to actually use the devices). I'm not a child and I don't need to be told a hundred times how to play music on it. And having this on my nightstand and seeing these highly annoying tips is just outrageous for a unit meant to be used next to a bed. Why doesn't Amazon fix this and give us the option to turn this nonsense off? I want to see a clock face, period, not these silly nanny reminders.","

I'm using to listen to free music with prime (better than alternatives), audible and you can even watch movies. The display is a little small for lots of watching, the sound should be louder, and YOUTUBE NEEDS TO BE AVAILABLE. These issues put this at a 3.5 to 4 stars. Fix one of them (youtube) and its a 5 star item. To alleviate sound I've paired with a blue tooth speaker. Right now this sits in my living area. Where I think it will shine is my office desk. Once there are great offers I could see purchasing additional for nightstand or other Amazon Alexa items for my household.

It works great for what I use it for: an alarm clock, a weather station, background music player and voice control of lights throughout my house. My biggest gripe about the device and why I knocked a star off is that you can't turn off the suggestions on &#34;Things to Try&#34;. It 's an annoying and a stupid design decision since you have control to turn off other things you don't want to see as it cycles through content screens.

Let's me know when a amazon order is arriving & has been delivered etc.  Yes it's a little pricey, but purchased it on Amazon Prime Now during Prime Day and it was delivered same day for $99.","

I'm so happy with this new device; it's a great replacement for my old clock.

"I love my little Echo Spot, I have replaced my older full size echo with this little guy. The round screen is an interesting choice and I'm not sure I like the look but it is growing on me. The speakers could be slightly louder but all in all it is a solid echo product.","

I have swapped out my full-sized Echo for the new Echo Spot, and while I'm not sure I'm a fan of the round display, it's starting to grow on me. The sound could be a bit louder, but overall it's a great Echo device."
"It's not as good as Siri, BUT it still has some positives, it's great at playing music, and setting alarms. I personally felt that I paid too much for this product, as it was nearly half off on prime day (literally the day after I purchased it). So I'm pretty disappointed. I might still return it and get my money back. .","

Although it's not as good as Siri, this product still has some advantages, such as its ability to play music and set alarms. I regret paying full price for it, since it was half off the day after I purchased it. I'm unhappy with my purchase and may return it to get my money back."
"Having received this as a gift, I am writing my initial thoughts: (compared to my google home mini)PROS:  Way easier to setup than the google home mini.  I was able to connect ALL of my smart home device (unlike google) without any issues.  Making phone calls on this was clearer for the receiver to understand me.CONS:  Need to enable 'skills' to get more functionality.  Google home has built in functionality to search the web for answer to questions easier than  the amazon echo.  Could not connect this to youtube.","

After receiving this as a present, I have the following initial impressions:PROS: Much easier to set up than the Google Home Mini. I had no issues connecting all of my smart home devices, whereas Google Home was not able to do this. The person on the other end of the phone call was able to understand me more clearly.CONS: I need to enable 'skills' in order to get more out of it. Google Home has built-in functions that make it easier to search the web for answers to questions, which the Amazon Echo does not have. I was unable to connect this to YouTube."

"Thank God, and alarm clock with an lcd that gets dim enough for me to sleep. I'm a very light sensitive sleeper and wind up taping black tape over all my other stuff in my bed room. Not this guy. The Alexa features are nice and listening to music at night is great. We enjoy falling asleep to meditation podcasts though we have to use the skill anypod to get the podcasts we like. Video is kinda tiny and useless at this size but that's to be expected. Audio quality is much better than echo dot.","

I'm so glad I got an alarm clock with an LCD that dims enough for me to sleep; I'm a very light sensitive sleeper and usually have to put black tape over my other bedroom items. This alarm clock is great because it has Alexa features, so we can listen to music at night and even use the AnyPod skill to listen to meditation podcasts. The video quality is a bit too small to be useful but that's to be expected; the audio quality is much better than the Echo Dot."

So glad I don’t have to deal with my old EEAANH EEAANH EEAANH alarm. Very excited to say “Alexa, turn off the lights” (smart plugs get here soon!) Got a camera privacy slide for this since it is in my bedroom.","

I'm so pleased with this purchase. Some may think I'm foolish for spending this amount of money on an enhanced alarm clock. Nonetheless, I'm not bothered by it. I value having a positive start to my day, and this helps me achieve that. I'm thrilled that I don't have to listen to my old EEAANH EEAANH EEAANH alarm anymore. I'm also looking forward to speaking the words ""Alexa, turn off the lights"" when my smart plugs arrive soon! I've even got a camera privacy slide for it since it is in my bedroom."
"I absolutely love this! Very user friendly and I got the Kasa Cam to go with it to monitor my living room. Super easy to set up and operate. I only wish it actually came with the camera privacy cover and pivoting stand which you can buy separately. I’m looking forward to future software updates for different clock faces. I like digital but I miss the colon in between the hours and minutes on most of them. I’d also like to see more celebs jump on board for the alarm voices. I really have no complaints, I’m being nit picky at this point. Worth every penny!","

Fairly useless.,"

Not very useful."
Bought the spot and loved it. Within months it started acting funny and would stop working—called and they determined that it was overheating. I was told to unplug and technical support would call within 24-48 hours. Waited 48 hours without response and replied to email and was asked to wait a week. A week goes by with absolutely no response so I do the inline chat per instructions. Told to wait longer. REALLY????  Unacceptable—expected more from Amazon. Find it funny how they always thank me for being a Prime member but when an issue arises I cannot even get assistance.,"

I purchased the item and was happy with it, but within months it began to malfunction. I contacted customer service and they determined that it was overheating. I was instructed to unplug it and that technical support would contact me within 24-48 hours. After waiting 48 hours without any response, I sent an email and was asked to wait another week. When the week passed and I still hadn't heard anything, I followed the instructions to do the online chat. Again, I was told to wait longer. I was disappointed in Amazon's service; it's ironic how they always thank me for being a Prime member, yet when I have an issue, I can't even get assistance."
"Much easier to use than the dot. It picks up my voice from farther away and the speakers seem a lot cleaner sounding The screen is a nice perk but I only use it at bed time to listen to prime shows before bed, the screen is too small to watch shows..It displays my alarm in print so I know Alexa heard me correctly. and you can make you own clock face with personal pictures.  My only complaint is that they don't add the stand as standard. I didn't need it for my spot at my desk but definitely needed it beside the bed.Many people complain about the basic Alexa program but it is still such new tech that I'm not going to split hairs.  The echo was not as good as my dot and the spot is better than dot.  Alexa gets better over time and the skills are increasing weekly. Now Alexa even tells the difference between my son and my voice. I think Amazon is working overtime on this project. I gave feedback to ask to be able to have self made lists and now you can make and name lists for anything.I am so used to my Alexa that I talk to her even when I'm staying in a hotel and she's no where to be found.  Alexa, what time is it?  ALEXA???!!","

The Echo is much more user-friendly than the Dot. It picks up my voice from farther away and the speakers are much clearer. The screen is a great addition but I only use it at night to listen to Prime shows; it's too small to watch shows. It also displays my alarm in print so I know Alexa heard me correctly and you can create your own clock face with personal images. The only downside is that the stand is not included as standard, so I had to buy one for my bedside. While some people may not be satisfied with the basic Alexa program, I think it is still very new technology and I'm not going to be too critical. Compared to the Dot, the Echo is much better and Alexa is constantly improving, with new skills being added every week. It can even differentiate between my son and my voice. Amazon is clearly putting a lot of effort into this project. I even gave feedback to ask for the ability to make lists and now you can create and name lists for anything.

"This is 1 of 6 echo devices in the house and is currently being deployed as a bedside alarm clock.  I use it basically as an echo dot with a clock attached and may occasionally pull up camera video.  Audio quality and screen quality are really are not appropriate for music or watching video.  Much of the time it works well as alarm clock, but there are some serious flaws, particularly if you are the last one to bed or the first to wake.  It doesn’t seem like the engineers actually tested this in a bedroom with 2 people on different schedules.  Try walking into a dark bedroom with a sleeping wife and waking her up by saying “Alexa set an alarm for 5am” and then having Alexa repeat “OK alarm set for 5am.”  Not good.  I suppose you could whisper then fumble for the volume down button but that is stupid.  Plain and simple, this device needs to be brought into the 1990’s and have simple touch screen interface added to set an alarm.  I know there is a cumbersome interface for these situations where one can set an alarm from the alexa app on your phone.  No thanks, if I’m picking up my phone to set an alarm I will just use its built in alarm and save a step.  At least the engineers allow the alarm to be turned off from the touch screen, so for example if you wake up a few minutes early you can cancel the alarm without speaking and waking your spouse.  The interface for using the touch screen to cancel an alarm that has gone off is however not great.  There should be separate snooze and cancel buttons.  Currently a touch snoozes and a swipe cancels.  It is too easy when half awake to snooze when you think you have cancelled.  When the snoozed alarm goes off a few minutes later, my not amused and no longer sleeping wife will let me know by summoning Alexa to turn off the bathroom lights while I’m in the shower.","

"4 out of 5 stars. I have the Original Tall Echo, 4 dots, 2 spots and 1 Show.  The only thing I'm finding a problem with is the speakers in the Spot. when using Drop In.  Sometimes I'm not being heard on the other spot and vice versa.  The voices tends break up or the sound coming through is intermittent. The optical is fine........ it's just the sound. Sometimes I'll have to repeat the wake word 2-3 times and I'm only 8 feet away plus it's on one of those $20 stands.  I find the ECHO DOT, Original echo and the Show has much better sound quality.  That's one reason I bought the Echo Show.","

"This thing is a lot cooler than I thought it would be.  I mostly have used it to read me audiobooks, but I also love that I can see into the camera while I'm at work.","

This item is much better than I anticipated. I mainly use it to listen to audiobooks, but I'm also delighted that I can keep an eye on the camera while I'm on the job."

We love the Show.  It loses the connection every now and then but not sure if that is an Show issue or our internet issue.  But overall we use it for many applications.,"

We are fond of the Show. It has an occasional disconnect, though we can't tell if it's the Show or our web service causing the problem. All in all, we utilize it for a variety of purposes."

It works wonderfully for music (especially paired with the Amazon music account) and is perfect with my ring doorbell. Love it!","

This device is amazing - it does exactly what I hoped it would, with no setup required. I can now both hear and see what I need, which is a huge improvement from my regular Echo. Music sounds great on it, especially when I use my Amazon music account, and it works perfectly with my Ring doorbell. I'm so happy with it!"

We have only had this for a week, but it has been a positive experience so far. We are very pleased with it."
"Love the product idea. Super easy to set up & get started, a breeze to do routine tasks (set alarms, timers, add items to shopping/to do lists, play music, get news, just about anything it's supposed to do). The sound is good where Imhave it sitting, not tinny at all as some have found. There is one thing I HATE & it would keep me from recommending it to anyone - you cannot delete from the nice screen the continually running suggestions of what to ask Alexa. Unless you have her turn off the screen totally which I do when I go to bed. And it's too bad bc it's like a continuously running advertisement or set-up guide. Not attractive. The echo show was on sale prior to Prime day for less than the Echo, so I figured I was getting a great deal for my money when trying to decide which device to start out with. Because of the ever present script it's not a nice device to look at, I would not buy it again, or recommend - go with the Echo. I may still exchange the product.","

Very excited to see what it can do,"

I can't wait to find out what it is capable of!"
"This is great for music, video calling, kitchen timers, and probably a bunch more. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the ever-floating ""things to try"" on the home screen. This is purely an aesthetic complaint, but hopefully soon Amazon allows the option to shut it off.","

This product is ideal for a variety of uses, such as music, video calling, and kitchen timers. The only issue I have with it is the ""things to try"" on the home screen, which I find to be visually distracting. I would give it five stars if Amazon gave the option of turning this feature off."
"I love the idea is the star trek computer at home. The skills are great, but the natural language work is mediocre.","

I am fond of the concept of having a Star Trek computer in my home; however, the capabilities are impressive but the natural language capabilities are not up to par."

I received this as a present and it's amazing! I can now see my newsfeed, recipes, shopping lists, and so much more!"

"Don't waste your money.  I own an echo gen 1, and echo gen 2 and a dot. They all do a far better job of voice recognition that the Echo Show.  In fact, it is so bad that it is virtually useless.  Also, the speaker is incredibly bass heavy....so much so that it is hard to understand voices.  I've worked to adjust the bass and punch the mids and treble, but it still sounds awful.  Finally, the screen just doesn't add much.  I can't see if from across the room, it rarely activates in any meaningful way, and when it doesn't, it is more of a distraction than a help.(Using FaceTime is so much more practicalthan using the Show.) I'm surprised Amazon didn't make this a little more useful than it is.  Perhaps in the future, but for now, it is a waste of time and money.","

Don't spend your hard-earned money on the Echo Show. I have the first and second generation Echo and a Dot, and they both have significantly better voice recognition than the Show. In addition, the speaker quality is so poor that it is difficult to understand voices, and I have tried to adjust the bass and treble settings to no avail. The screen is also not very useful, as it is too small to be seen from across the room and rarely activates in a meaningful way. FaceTime is a much more practical choice. It's a shame that Amazon didn't make the Show more useful, but as of now it is a waste of time and money."
I love it. It does everything.,"

I'm really fond of it. It can do anything."

My wife has been using Skype for years to have daily conversations with her parents, but the technology has been problematic. Her father, who is 88, still manages to uninstall, reinstall, and reconfigure Skype, but I was excited when I found a product that was simpler to use. Despite her initial hesitation to learn something new, I reminded her of the video phones I saw at the New York World's Fair in 1964. To our delight, it was easy to set up and worked perfectly.

Had I payed full price it would have been returned. There are other features that are nice, but I may never use them.","

If I had paid full price, I would have sent it back. Although there are some nice features, I may never use them."

"Unit is working great, but it is a true PIA that products today are shipped without user manuals. Do manufacturers truly believe that user will magically know the full capabilities of each product purchased? I have no idea of the echo show's capabilities. I have it linked to my Hue lights, but have no idea what commands will work, and what won't. I purchased a Fire TV Stick along with the Show, but have no idea how to maximize the two. Just a few examples.I even purchased a text that other users have found to be helpful. Seems way too basic to me, but better than a kick in the pants.","

The unit is working well, but it's incredibly frustrating that products nowadays don't come with user manuals. Do the manufacturers really think that customers will intuitively know the full range of possibilities with each product? I have no clue what the Echo Show is able to do. I've connected it to my Hue lights, but I'm in the dark about which commands will work and which won't. I also got a Fire TV Stick with the Show, but I'm not sure how to make the most of them both. Just a few examples. I even bought a book that other users have found useful, but it seems too basic for me. Still, it's better than nothing."

"Do not understand all the excitement over these alexa devices or the google ones either.  It rarely gets what I say correct, does not control the Dish receiver.  Yes I set it up correctly, using the alexa app on my phone.  We got this for 129,  which is a good deal, ti is definately not worth the 229 price though.  Maybe in another month it will get better, or either I have one that is just deaf and dumb.  Really can not recommend this item at the current time","

I'm not sure why everyone is so enthusiastic about these Alexa and Google devices; mine rarely understands what I say and can't even control my Dish receiver. I set it up correctly using the Alexa app on my phone, and for the price of 129 it's not a bad deal, but I wouldn't pay 229 for it. Maybe it will improve in a month, or maybe I just have a defective one. I can't really recommend it right now."

It’s definitely a source of relief to my parents that they can so easily pop in onme and visa versa.I’d also like to thank Amazon for including their VoiceView screen reader on the device.

I absolutely adore this TV show, even though its microphones aren't as sensitive as my dots, which can pick up my voice from across the house. Nevertheless, I love being able to watch TV and movies in the kitchen, or have the news or music playing - I'm in love with it!"
"I basically use it to play music  and tell me the news..its sometimes hard to communicate with it, if i dont say the command correctly, but i realize its learning my style of speaking and will do some commands even though i dont say them exactly as i should.","

I primarily use it to play music and keep me up to date on the news. It can be tricky to get it to understand my commands if I don't phrase them correctly, but I've noticed that it's learning to recognize my speech patterns and will even do some tasks without me having to say the command precisely."

"I love the Echo Show!! I have the dot and have been using that for the last 6 months,  but the Show is so much better.  The sound quality is amazing and the screen resolution is like watching a mini 4K tv.  I love being able to see my timers, events and list instead of having them read to me.  I purchased this on prime day, and it is worth every penny.  When the dot was given to me, I thought ""this is a cute novelty,  but I'll probably never use it"". Was I wrong!!  Echo is part of my daily routine,  and has made my life so much easier.","

I'm so glad I got the Echo Show! After using the Dot for the past 6 months, the Show is a major upgrade. The sound quality is incredible and the screen resolution is like having a tiny 4K TV. I love being able to actually see my lists, timers, and events instead of just having them read to me. I got this on Prime Day and it was worth every penny.

"So far I’m very pleased with my Echo Show.  The problem is, there’s so much it can do that I haven’t been able to explore the extent of its abilities! I got the special price as part of the Prime Day promotion...and you just can’t beat what you get for the price.  Very pleased with the sound. The video screen is sharp. Sometimes it takes a few tries to get Alexa to perform a command...but as I get to know the system better, I’m hoping that will improve.  One drawback in the music...I’ve noticed a lot of the songs from years past, are re-recordings by the original artist...but not the original recording itself.  Example: Secret Agent Man by Johnny Rivers...a “live”version is used, not the original version.  If I’m going to pay for Prime Music...I’d like to hear the original version of songs...not later recordings.  Or at least give me a choice of what I want to hear.  Otherwise, I am very pleased with my Echo Show.  So pleased in fact, that I bought a second one!","

I have been really pleased with my Echo Show, as it has so many features that I haven't even been able to explore yet. I got a great deal on it during the Prime Day promotion, and the sound and video quality are great. I have found that sometimes it takes a few attempts to get Alexa to understand my commands, but I'm sure that will improve as I become more familiar with the system. The only issue I have is with the music; a lot of older songs are re-recordings by the original artist, not the original version, such as Johnny Rivers' ""Secret Agent Man"". If I'm going to pay for Prime Music, I would like to be able to hear the original versions of songs, or at least have the choice. Despite this, I am still very satisfied with my Echo Show, so much so that I bought a second one!"

However, it just doesn't work as intended.I find myself irritated more often than not when I use this device."," It's almost as if I have another child in the house - I have to keep repeating myself because Alexa misinterprets what I say.

"After two weeks I am not sure if I like the ever present Alexa to have a screen as well.  I bought it to be a abay monitor combined with a wifi camera, and that works.  But the screen is always on unless you tell it to turn it off - instead of just a talking cylinder you now have a mini screen that not only talks to you but also writes out everything it says or shows accompanying video.  There is something about only audio that made Alexa different, no I some ways it is a TV that you can talk to.","

After two weeks, I'm not sure if I'm a fan of the new Alexa with a screen. I bought it to use as a baby monitor combined with a wifi camera, and that works great. However, the screen is always on unless you manually tell it to turn off. Instead of just being a voice-activated cylinder, it now has a mini screen that not only speaks to you, but also displays visuals and videos. There was something special about only having audio that made Alexa stand out, and now it's almost like having a TV that you can talk to."

"I bought this product hoping that Alexa would be pretty well developed and far enough along, therefore expecting her to be responsive. This $100 piece of crap doesnt even know how to respond to a question that amazon themselves told me to ask her. (Echo buttons manual, see Step 3.) The device has potential given it has a big screen, decent sound but for 200 bucks, I would never reccomend it. Even for the $100 I spent, I feel like I got shorted. Oh and lastly, the device is pretty useless without a prime membership. I linked my personal account to it and the thing was literally a decorated bluetooth speaker. I went on the family account (this one) and got it to work minimal. Oh, and even with our prime membership, you have to have a music pass or something that's an extra 3.99 a month, leaving this item a subscription nightmare, and a overpriced, decorated bluetooth speaker in my eyes. I would give it zero stars if I could.","

I purchased this product in the expectation that Alexa would be advanced and able to respond to my questions; however, the $100 device was unable to even understand a question that Amazon themselves said to ask. It has potential with its big screen and sound, but I would never recommend it for the price of $200. I paid $100 for it and feel like I was taken advantage of. To make matters worse, it is virtually useless without a Prime membership. When I linked it to my personal account, it was just a fancy Bluetooth speaker. I did get it to work with our family account, but then I had to pay an extra $3.99 a month for a music pass. This makes it a subscription nightmare and I would give it no stars if I could."
"quite nice...clear, great sound.","

Very pleasant...crystal clear, superb sound."
"Versatile use, can watch movies or news.  Able to use as remote for vehicle.  Or use as a communication hub for the home.  Great produc!!!","

I purchased two of the item - one for myself and the other for my daughter who lives in a different state. We are both thrilled with it!"
"Our family bought several of these to help communicate with older parents and grandparents who need simpler devices than a full-fledged tablet.  What fantastic potential these have - for digital photo screen, video calls, easy accesss to music, audio books, etc. However, once we have them setup, we discovered the huge lurking negative.  Amazon forces you to view continous spam on the home screen promoting all their Alexa features.  You can turn off many other things in settins, but you cannot turn off &#34;Things to Try&#34;.  Instead of a beautiful digital photo screen with weather and time ... we now constantly have a spam ad across the home screen that says, &#34;Try ......&#34;.  AMAZON, please listen to your customers and offer a setting to turn off this SPAM!","

Our family bought some of these devices to make it easier to stay in contact with elderly relatives who require simpler technology than a tablet. We were so excited about the potential of using these for digital photo screens, video calls, music, audio books and more! However, once we had it all set up, we encountered an unfortunate issue. Amazon does not give you the option to turn off the 'Things to Try' feature on the home screen, meaning that instead of a beautiful digital photo screen with weather and time, we now have a spam advertisement across the home screen. Amazon, please listen to your customers and provide a setting to turn off this spam!"
The best part about owning this is that my mother who is anti-technology uses this with ease everyday and finds new reasons to use it as well. Well done.,"

I'm thrilled that my mother, who is not tech-savvy, is able to use this product with ease and discovers new ways to use it every day."
"It’s my second one, so I put this one in the kitchen for recipes.","

This is my second one, so I decided to place it in the kitchen for looking up recipes."
Echo Show is perfect for staging in the kitchen so recipes are right there. No need to print them. Wonderful device. Acoustical sounds are not as powerful as our tall cylindercal echo but we have that covered in the adjacent family room.,"

The Echo Show is great for having in the kitchen, so you don't need to print out recipes. It's a great device, however the sound quality isn't as strong as our cylindrical Echo in the family room, but that's taken care of."
"Great fun but frustrating at times. Commands between tv and the show get mixed (asking to watch something will turn my directv, not display on show which stinks with an 8 year old) Also would like more video options with flash briefings. Still really a tech wonder for a low price.","

Having a lot of fun with it, but it can be a bit irritating at times. The commands between the TV and the show can be confusing (for example, when I ask to watch something, it turns on my DirecTV instead of displaying the show, which can be irritating when I'm trying to show something to my 8 year old). I would also like to have more video options with the Flash Briefings. Despite these minor issues, it's still a great piece of technology for a low price."
Love that you can play music and see the lyrics.  Connected to my echo dot I enjoy listening in multiple rooms.,"

I am delighted to be able to play music and view the lyrics with my Echo Dot, allowing me to listen to music in multiple areas of my home."
"I love Alexa and when I had the chance to add Show to my home... I jumped at it.  But... I'm a member and my Show doesn't know I paid for the extras with my Echo (now in the upstairs bedroom.  If I am supposed to pay more for having Show added to my home, then I'm afraid to ask &#34;What's the point?&#34;","

When I had the opportunity to get an Amazon Show for my home, I was thrilled. However, I already have an Echo in my upstairs bedroom and I'm not sure if I need to pay extra for the Show. If that's the case, I'm left wondering what the purpose of adding the Show is."
Purchased as a more &#34;personal&#34; contact vehicle for engaging with long distance grandchildren. Works perfectly in every regard. Resolution and sound both better than expected. Highly recommend.,"

I bought this as a way to have more of a personal connection with my grandchildren who live far away, and it has worked out great. The image quality and sound are both better than I thought they would be, and I would definitely recommend it."
"Works well, pictures awesome! Sound could be better. Must be on the same bandwidth as other Alexa devices for whole home music. 2.4ghz vs 5ghz.","

The performance is great and the visuals are stunning, however, the sound quality could be improved. In order to have whole home music, all Alexa devices must be connected to the same bandwidth, either 2.4GHz or 5GHz."
"I am pleased with the Echo Show, from the sound of the music and the words to the tunes to the news and weather. The color on the screen for my photos could be better.","

I am very satisfied with the Echo Show, from the audio to the lyrics to the news and weather. However, the colors for my pictures could be improved."

The packaging was gorgeous and then there she was! We already had two Dots and an Echo Plus, but now we have the Show and we absolutely adore it. Now, we have an Echo in every room! You can also say ""Alexa, turn off the screen"" and it will go dark. This is great for when you want to go to sleep."
"The ability to respond with the accuracy and variety of information provided by Google search has spoiled me.I had originally expected to see that the same type of search engine in the Echo.Not so, the ability of Alexa to provide such detailed information is not part of the package.Perhaps improvements are in the offing with further updates.","

I had expected the Echo to have the same kind of search engine as Google, but unfortunately that is not the case. Alexa's capability to provide such specific information is not yet available. Hopefully, with further updates, this will change."
"My daughter has an Echo Show and she told me how much she loved it. I bought a white one for my kitchen and absolutely love it!  It has all the features of the others plus great extras. The sound system is awesome. I also own the original Echo Tower, Dots and Spot. Each are great and have their uses around my house. I highly recommend all of these products.","

My daughter was so enthusiastic about her Echo Show that I decided to get one for my kitchen too. I'm really glad I did because it has a lot of additional features compared to the other Echo products, and the sound quality is superb. I also have the original Echo Tower, Dots and Spot, and each of them are great for different purposes around the house. I would definitely recommend all of these products."

I'm a big fan of the show me option. Additionally, I enjoy video chatting with other people."
"I love this device.  I bought it simple so that I can have an alarm clock with my Amazon Echo.....and during Prime day for the price you couldn't beat it.  But, I have Sonos and Big Ass Fan lights that I am able to control with this device.  It's perfect and getting better all the time.","

I was so pleased with my purchase of this device, especially since I got it at an unbeatable price during Prime day. Not only does it serve as an alarm clock with my Amazon Echo, but I'm also able to control my Sonos and Big Ass Fan lights with it. It's great and keeps getting better!"
The ase of participating with Echo,"

"I like the weather options but Alexa search compacity needs improvement. She aint no Google. Alexa gets our requests probably around 20% of the time. Currently Alexa doesn't do YouTube either. This is a huge drawback and why The echo show dropped in price.  International radio via tune in is awesome but again her search engine, its like pulling teeth to get to anything.","

I enjoy the different weather options that Alexa offers, but her search capabilities are in need of improvement. She can't quite match up to Google yet, and only manages to get our requests right around 20% of the time. Additionally, Alexa doesn't have YouTube capabilities, which is why the Echo Show's price dropped. Tune In provides great international radio, but it's still quite difficult to find what you're looking for using Alexa's search engine."

"We’ve had the original Echo for quite some time and just recently added the Show.  It was simple to setup and more inviting to use with the visual interface.  The Echo is being used as the primary interface for my connected home system which is currently only controlling lights and switches.  I look forward to expanding on that capability.  We also use it for maintaining lists, as a music player, general information, and entertainment.  I haven’t used the Show to shuffle through our favorite  photographs but will start that soon.","

We have had the original Echo for a while and just got the Show recently. It was easy to set up and the visual interface was more inviting. We mainly use the Echo to control lights and switches in our connected home system, however we plan to expand its capabilities.

"I like the option for white, but it’s bizarre that it comes with a black cord. I have a white kitchen, so now I have this stands-out-like-a-sore-thumb black power cord. For aesthetic purposes, I was happier with my year-old white Echo (not Show) because it came with a white powercord. This seems like a major design flaw in the “white” option. I strongly urge Amazon to change out the powercord to white.","

I'm partial to the white option, but it's strange that it comes with a black power cord. It's very noticeable in my white kitchen and doesn't match. I was much happier with my older white Echo (not Show) because it had a white power cord. This seems like a major design mistake with the white option, so I would strongly suggest that Amazon switch the power cord to white."
I am very pleased with the Echo Show! I love that it has so many nice features. I highly recommend it.,"

I'm delighted with the Echo Show! It has a ton of great features that make it really worthwhile. I would definitely recommend it."

I am overjoyed with this item. Additionally, I am so grateful for Amazon because my Echo Show malfunctioned and all it took was a quick conversation and suddenly, a new one was on the way.

"This was my 4th echo device, 1st echo show  it seemed to have huge potential, and I really wanted to like it, but soon found out it is quite limited. A bit disappointing, but not the end of the world, I used it like I use my other, screenless echos.... For a little under 2 month, when the screen started flickering, mostly on the bottom of the screen but not just. A quick look in some forums made me understand it is pointless asking for a replacement, as some people had 2-3 devices replaced, only to start flickering again shortly after. Amazon are not providing any serious answers, and this has been going on for quite some time apparently.Long story short, I moved it to the hallway, and been using it as a very expensive... and bulky voice activated light switch for my hue lights. So like the headline suggests... Meh.","

This was my fourth Echo device and my first Echo Show. I had high hopes for it, but soon realized that it was quite limited. Although a bit disappointing, I still used it like my other Echo devices without a screen. Unfortunately, after using it for around two months, the screen began to flicker, mostly at the bottom but not exclusively. After doing some research, I found out that it was futile to ask for a replacement as some people had gone through two or three devices, only for them to start flickering again shortly after. Amazon hasn't provided any useful answers, and this issue has been going on for a while. In short, I moved it to the hallway and used it as an expensive and bulky voice-activated light switch for my Hue lights. So, as the headline suggests: Meh."
Love it to play music works great for finding recipes. Need more family to have adapted machines to see,"

I enjoy making music and it is great for finding recipes. We need more family members to have access to computers in order to view them."
"It seems a little less intuitive then the regular Echo Plus. It's also a little harder for it to pick up what you're saying.  When combined with the other four we have in the household, having to speak loud enough for it to hear was cross activating other ones, so we had to rename this one.  Overall it works well, but does not seem as adept at doing things as the original Echo Plus.","

This particular Echo Plus appears to be less user-friendly than the regular one, and it's more difficult for it to understand what you're saying. Since we have four of them in the house, we had to rename this one so that speaking loudly wouldn't activate the other ones. Even though it functions properly, it doesn't seem to be as capable as the original Echo Plus."
This is my second Show.  I like them very much.  I use mine for music and my Arlo security cameras.  I can connect and display my outdoor cameras by voice. They are exceptionally capable devices.  I highly recommend them.,"

I've had two of these Shows now and I'm really impressed with them. I use them for music and to access my Arlo security cameras. It's so convenient to be able to view my outdoor cameras just by speaking a command. These devices are incredibly powerful and I would highly recommend them."

I've had this for about a week now and I'm really enjoying being able to control things in my house while I'm away. It gives me peace of mind knowing that I can still keep tabs on the house even if I'm not there, and no one has to know that we are away. So far, Alexa has been a great addition!"

It not quite the surround-like quality of a Bluetooth speaker in the $100+ range, but its very good none the less.  And with even basic access to Amazon Music there is a lot to listen to.  There's a huge number of things Alexa can do, learning more every day.","

I was taken aback when I found out this item could be used as a Bluetooth speaker for phones and tablets. I guess it was mentioned in the product description, but I must have overlooked it. It doesn't have the same surround-sound quality as the more expensive Bluetooth speakers, but it still sounds great. Plus, with access to Amazon Music, there's a lot of content to choose from. Alexa can do a lot of different things and is constantly learning new skills."

This product is truly amazing, with fast responses! However, Alexa could use more content and a wider selection of music. It currently uses Bing as its search engine instead of Google, which would make it even better if the two were combined."

The unit is very responsive and can easily respond even with TV or music playing.I did pair two smart  bulbs and they go on, off and dim with ease using voice or app. Fidelity is very good for the size.My only regret is that I would have liked a silver model or a fabric cover but that is an unimportant issue.","

I am amazed by the precision of Alexa. It is incredibly responsive and can answer questions even with the TV or music playing. I was able to connect two smart bulbs with ease and they can be turned on, off, and dimmed with either voice commands or the app. The sound quality is great for its size. The only downside is that I wish there was a silver model or a fabric cover, but that is a minor issue."

The new Alexa we got is pretty similar to the old one - she's still as stubborn as ever!

We got this mainly for our son who is currently vision impaired ! it has many good things and setup was fairly easy once I did the first one but they should be easier to setup and come loaded with more stuff ! it should do Text messages to friends easier without them having to download something for it to work and it should link with email and also them common social media like facebook and twitter and others !the whole purpose was to get him back connected to the Web by voice so he wouldn't feel left out and isolated ! they should also have a tech support phone number to call or a way to do direct help to the Echo so tech support can help setup the device ! I had to get a friend whos an IT guy to come help me setup," the other one

We mainly got this device for our son, who is vision impaired. It has a lot of great features and the setup wasn't too difficult after I set up the first one, but they should make it easier to set up and come with more pre-loaded features. It should be easier to send text messages to friends without them having to download something for it to work, and it should be able to link with email and popular social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, and others. The goal was to get him back connected to the Web by voice so he wouldn't feel left out and isolated. They should also provide a tech support phone number or a way to provide direct help to the Echo so tech support can assist with the setup of the device.

I think I heard her sigh in exasperation.I tried to create a playlist of songs I like only to have it ignored.  I am learning workarounds but they are mediocre, at best...and, as yet do not include a personal playlist.I have scoured the beginners section but the beginners it addresses are far more advanced in basic Alexa than am I.So far, I like what I have been able to use but I'd like it a lot more if I could configure it to my needs, rather than accepting the Amazon/Alexa default.Karen","

It is difficult for me to review this product since I am part of the problem. I am 75 years old and got it for my dog to have some background noise when I am not home. Although I am familiar with computer programs like iTunes, Amazon, and many others, I am having difficulty communicating with Alexa. I swear I heard her sigh in frustration. I attempted to create a playlist of my favorite songs only to have it be ignored. I am trying to find alternate methods to use, but they are not ideal. Even after reading the beginner's section, I still feel like I am at a disadvantage. I do like what I have been able to use, but it would be better if I could customize it to my preferences instead of using the default Amazon/Alexa settings."

If you call something &#34;light&#34; in the app you need to say light, not &#34;lights.&#34; Echo Plus has no problems as a smart hub but I could use better user directions. Well worth owning and a good step to making my home Smart!","

Although not perfect, Echo Plus is still very good. On a few occasions Alexa has picked up something from the television and has a slight difficulty with smart home devices as it sometimes gets confused with the names we give them. For example, if you call something ""light"" in the app, you need to say ""light"" and not ""lights"". As a smart hub, Echo Plus works without any issues, but I could use better guidance on how to use it. Despite this, it is still worth owning and is a great way to make my home smarter."

I also bought a 4k fire TV and it can open Amazon prime video or Netflix at any moment. The included hue lighting makes this product even better. I found myself with a whole array of smart lights perfect for any house or entertainment room. The addition of phone calls on the mic and speaker makes it practical when your busy in the kitchen or on the computer. Alexa will controll it all as soon as you say ""Hey Alexa"".

"I purchased the Amazon Echo Plus on Amazon prime day because I need a hub. I'm in the process of upgrading my home into a smart home. For the same price as some hub's, and even less expensive in some other cases. I got a hub that works with my devices, plus it does a lot more. I haven't even had time to go through all the skills it has, but I've already found myself using many of them. When I started a search for a hub. I wasn't even considering the Echo. In part, because I didn't know it was a hub. But also because I didn't really think I would find much use for another AI system. If you're looking for a hub. Why settle for a plane hub, when you can get a personal assistant that does so much more and yet cost's the same or less than other hubs? Oh! And by the way. For the same price as the Amazon Echo Plus alone. I found one that came bundled with a smart bulb & saw another that came with a smart plug. Given the price of these extras. Well, that just put the Echo Plus over the top.","

I decided to buy the Amazon Echo Plus on Amazon Prime Day because I needed a hub to upgrade my home into a smart home. It was the same price as some other hubs, and even cheaper in some cases. I found the Echo Plus had a lot of extra features that I wasn't expecting. I hadn't even had the chance to explore all of the skills it has, yet I already found myself using many of them. Initially, I wasn't even considering the Echo because I wasn't aware it was a hub and I didn't think I would find much use for another AI system. If you're looking for a hub, why not get one that does more than just the basics for the same or lower price? Plus, I found a bundle that included the Echo Plus and a smart bulb for the same price as the Echo Plus alone. Some bundles even included a smart plug at no extra cost. This made the Echo Plus an even better deal."

Purchasing from Love Warehouse was a great decision. The item I got was in such good condition that it was almost like it was brand new. There wasn't a single flaw on it. I'm really pleased with my purchase!"
Alexa is awesome! The first day I got my Echo Plus I found out things that she can do that I didn’t think were even possible. I highly recommend this product. Along with all the accessories.,"

On the first day I got my Echo Plus, I was amazed at the capabilities of Alexa and the possibilities she presented. I highly suggest this product and all its accessories to anyone looking for an incredible experience."
Ease of set up. I’ll have fun sitting up other features as well as making my house a smart home.,"

I'm looking forward to setting up the different features and making my home a smart house with ease."
I try use with yale lock but isn’t work,"

I attempted to use a Yale lock, but it did not function properly."
IT SEEMS TO BE OK BUT THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE WEAK AND I CAN NOT SEEM TO GET IT TO WORK. I AM GOING TO GET MY TECHY FRIEND TO HELP ME OUT AND I WILL UPDATE YOU LATER,".

It appears to be functioning properly, however the instructions are not clear enough for me to get it to work. I'm going to ask my tech-savvy friend to help me out and I'll let you know the results later."
"I love everything about it. I love that the echo plus turns on and off my light. It can also dim them with voice commands. I also like listening to my kindle books even the ones that I didn’t purchased  audibles for. I like that it can play my music from Amazon music, pandora, tunein, I heart radio and Spotify. Echo can even play my local radio station. I love that the echo is connected to my TiVo Bolt. This allows TiVo to pause, stop and play whatever I want with a simple voice command. I love that I can reorder items that I purchased on Amazon and that the echo plus notifies me when my order is mailed, when it will be delivered and when the package has been delivered.  The only three dislikes that I have is that if you’re up too close or to far the echo doesn’t respond. So I think they need to improve the microphone. And I wish the speaker was better. The speakers are okay but could be improved. Also I have the echo dot and it never has given me any problems with the internet. Well the other day I received a Red Light Right on my Echo Plus. This error was Sorry I’m having trouble understanding you please try again later. After research online I learned it was a problem connecting to my internet. And it was easy to find this out. And I found it odd that my dot wasn’t having this problem even though they are connected to the same network.","

I absolutely adore my Echo Plus: it can turn on and off my lights, dim them, and even play my Kindle books without needing Audible. It can also play music from Amazon Music, Pandora, TuneIn, I Heart Radio, and Spotify, as well as my local radio station. I also love that I can use it to control my TiVo Bolt and reorder items from Amazon. The only three downsides I've noticed are that the microphone is not very good at picking up my voice if I'm too close or too far, the speaker could be better, and I recently got a 'Sorry, I'm having trouble understanding you' error on my Echo Plus, which I found out was due to an issue with the internet connection. Oddly enough, my Echo Dot was connected to the same network and didn't have any issues."
Love everything about this....,"

I have a great fondness for this in its entirety."
Perfect for controlling my tp-link smart devises,"

Ideal for managing my TP-Link intelligent devices."

I'm thoroughly impressed with the language recognition - it's the most proficient I've seen! The sound quality is also superb."

I absolutely ADORE my Echo Plus! It was so easy to install. Alexa has now become my closest companion. Amazon's 24/7 customer service is unbeatable! Any inquiries I have can be answered anytime. What more could I possibly ask for?!"

It has to be one of the most awesome things."
Awesome! Easy set up. Linked right up with my Nexia home automation.,"

I enjoy the various functions of the device,"

"Alread had Echos and Dots, but the ability to control Philips Hue bulbs nudged me to buy this on Prime Day.  Another fun product from Amazon.","

I already owned Echos and Dots, but the capability to regulate Philips Hue bulbs pushed me to purchase this on Prime Day. It was yet another enjoyable product from Amazon."
"I purchased the Echo Plus with the Build-in Hub, so I could have the convenience of asking Alexa to turn my lights and lamps on and off.  Philips Hue Light Bulbs were placed in the fixtures that I wanted Alexa to control and they all work great!  I already had an Echo Dot in my Kitchen/Den area, so I placed the Echo Plus with Hub in my bedroom. My radio and lamps in my Kitchen and Den are controlled with TP-Link plugs.  But, the ceiling light fixtures and lamp in my Den and Bedroom have special Philips Hue Light Bulbs that are controlled by the Hub inside the Echo Plus.  I am able to play music, set my alarm, get weather reports and numerous other things on both devices.  The Echo Dot requires a TP-Link plug to be plugged into it and the Echo Plus requires a special Philips Light Bulbs installed in each light fixture to work..  The only thing I dislike is the high price of the light bulbs required to make the lights work. Regular light bulbs placed in the ceiling light fixtures will not work with Alexa and  the Echo Plus with Hub.  Other than the high price of the bulbs, I love my Echo Plus with built in hub!","

I bought the Echo Plus with the integrated Hub so I could have the advantage of asking Alexa to switch my lights and lamps on and off. I put Philips Hue Light Bulbs in the fixtures I wanted Alexa to control and they all function perfectly. I already had an Echo Dot in my Kitchen/Den area, so I placed the Echo Plus with Hub in my bedroom. The radio and lamps in my Kitchen and Den are managed with TP-Link plugs. The ceiling light fixtures and lamp in my Den and Bedroom, however, have special Philips Hue Light Bulbs that are handled by the Hub inside the Echo Plus. I'm able to play music, set my alarm, get weather reports and do many other things on both devices. The Echo Dot needs a TP-Link plug to be plugged into it and the Echo Plus needs special Philips Light Bulbs installed in each light fixture to work. The only thing I don't like is the high cost of the light bulbs necessary to make the lights work. Regular light bulbs placed in the ceiling light fixtures won't work with Alexa and the Echo Plus with Hub. Other than the expensive bulbs, I adore my Echo Plus with built-in hub!"

I purchased this item due to its ability to be used with a smart hub. It has been a great purchase so far, with easy setup instructions for all of the different brands that it is compatible with."
"The sound is wonderful and it just plain works. I wish it cost less, but it is worth the cost. (especially on Prime Day)","

The sound quality is superb and it functions perfectly. I wish it was cheaper, but it is worth the price tag (especially during Prime Day)."
Comes with a hub.  Got it during prime day for $99 and a hue white bulb.  Works great.  Now I can add more stuff that required a hub!,"

I took advantage of Prime Day and got a hub and a Hue White bulb for only $99. Everything works great and now I'm able to expand my setup with other products that need a hub!"

"It's fun to imagine the household management options ...Some info questions baffle Alexa, but other options are cool - esp. music-related ...","

It can be entertaining to think about the possibilities of household management with Alexa, although some queries may be too difficult for her to answer. Still, there are some really neat features, especially when it comes to music."

My first smart buy..I am loving it and all the great things Alexa can do.,"

I am really enjoying my initial purchase of a smart device and all the awesome tasks Alexa can complete."
"This thing is awesome!  I got it on Prime Day for a great deal.  I wish I had purchased two.  I also bought the Echo Show version, but the sound is not nearly as good as the Echo Plus.  The Echo Show came dented, so I will be exchanging it.  I like the screen and many of the features so I will not be getting a refund.  It was still worth the price.","

I am really impressed with this product that I got on Prime Day at a great price. I regret not buying two; I also got the Echo Show but the audio quality is nowhere near as good as the Echo Plus. Unfortunately, the Echo Show arrived dented, so I am exchanging it instead of getting a refund. Despite this, I still think it was worth the cost."
Is great having a new friend,"

It's fantastic to have a new friend."
Coop product many uses including smart devices throughout the home,"

Coop products have many applications, such as being used in smart devices in homes."

This unit is incredibly easy to set up and has amazing sound quality, earning it a 10/10 rating in my book. It's an absolute must-have for both office and home use. I am now looking into adding other devices, such as locks and lights, to my home."
Better than expected!,"

Fantastic!"

I'm still learning how to use it and it took me a while to get it set up, but I managed to do it somehow and it's great!"
It's fantastic. Very happy with the purchase.,"

I'm ecstatic with the purchase. It's great!"
Love it!!!,"

I'm really into it!"
I like the list ability and the music I can play.  I do not like that I can not create a playlist without using the app and even then Alexa will not play my songs I have to do it through my tablet or phone.  I also do not like that Alex can not print again it has to be done through the app.,"

I appreciate the list feature and the music I can play, however, I am not a fan of the fact that I cannot make a playlist without using the app, and then Alexa won't even play my songs - I have to do it through my tablet or phone. Additionally, I don't like that Alexa cannot print either, I have to do it through the app."
"It is a great bundle of fun. Music ,games, questions etc. I luv it turns off my smart lights. I purchase 4 more smart light for my lamps in the living room and my room!","

Having a great time with music, games, and questions is so enjoyable. I love how I can turn off my smart lights with it. I bought four more smart lights for the lamps in my living room and bedroom!"
First time using Alexa and so far I love it.,"

This is my initial experience with Alexa and I'm really enjoying it."
"It was a little hard to follow their instructions, great product","

It was somewhat difficult to comprehend their directions, however the item was excellent."
"This was a replacement. It was really easy to set up. I had to reauthorize my smart items to work with the new hub, but installation was easy and instructions were clear.","

The new hub was a breeze to install. I just had to re-establish the connection with my smart items, but the process was straightforward and the instructions were easy to follow."
Really cool device that does a ton of stuff. Fun games like Jeopardy. We used this to set up smart bulbs and light switches. Make sure you ge the stuff that corresponds with this particular hub. Had to make a few runs back to the store for exchanges.,"

This device is really awesome and can do a lot of things. It even has fun games like Jeopardy. We used it to connect our smart bulbs and light switches. Make sure you get the right accessories that go with this hub. We had to go back to the store a few times to exchange some items."
"I’ve been waiting for Prime Day to purchase an Echo Plus and now, I’m enjoying learning what Alexa can do. With a new Sonos One and an Echo Dot, I have the makings of a really nice and well-integrated smart home. Love it!","

I had been eagerly anticipating Prime Day in order to buy an Echo Plus, and I'm now having a blast discovering all the things Alexa can do. With the addition of a Sonos One and an Echo Dot, I have the perfect setup for a sophisticated, interconnected smart home. I'm loving it!"
"I haven't had it very long, but so far our whole family is enjoying asking Alexa questions!","

We just got Alexa not too long ago and the whole family is having fun asking it questions!"
"Although this is my second echo device, I am still very disappointed that there is almost no documentation/instructions as to the many functions of the device.  I purchased becausse of the sound quality, but only found out it has bluetooth capabilities last night by accident.  There needs to be a manual that details all of the functionality of the device.  Or at least point out where it can be found...","

Despite having bought my second Echo device, I am still very dissatisfied that there is almost no information about its various features. I was initially attracted to it for its sound quality, but only found out it had Bluetooth capabilities by chance last night. There needs to be a guide that outlines all the features of the device, or at least offers directions on how to locate it."
"The Echoplus is a great extension for the Echo Dots in our home. I am a little disappointed that Alexa is not as good at information requests as Google. But as a start on home automation, she is very impressive.","

I'm quite pleased with the Echoplus as an addition to our Echo Dots at home. Unfortunately, Alexa doesn't seem to be as adept at providing answers to questions as Google is. However, she's still quite remarkable for a beginning in home automation."
I never had ALEXA before but the biggest reason I bought it was for YOUTUBE and apparently YOUTUBE stopped supporting it and that is why it will get 4 stars.... it's mostly YOUTUBE's FAULT but I worked around it by using my cell phone as a blue tooth connected to hear things but still takes the voice activate purpose away but the speaker is amazing to hear my youtube watch later playlist,"

I had never owned an ALEXA before, but the main reason I bought it was for YOUTUBE. Unfortunately, YOUTUBE stopped supporting it, so I'm only giving it 4 stars. It's mostly YOUTUBE's fault, but I managed to work around it by using my cell phone as a bluetooth connection to hear things. This still takes away the voice activation feature, but the sound quality of the speaker is great for listening to my YouTube watch later playlist."
Awesome!! Loving Alexa,"

I'm really enjoying my Alexa!"
no habla espanol,"

No hablo español."
Love the music the stories," you tell

I am a fan of the music and the tales you share."
It is fantastic.,"

It is marvelous."
Like it but it will take time to setup all the skills I want simply because there are so many. I already use music and Flash Briefing daily. Very satisfied. I use this along with Alexa app on my Kindle hd8,"

It will take me some time to configure all the skills I want since there are so many, but I am content with the current setup of Music and Flash Briefing that I use daily. I also have the Alexa app on my Kindle hd8."
"Wish it would have came with the lightbulb, but otherwise works great, fast delivery, and I enjoy using it!","

I wish the lightbulb had been included, but apart from that, the product works great, it arrived quickly and I'm very pleased with it!"
"Still haven’t learn all the Echo can do, but so far, quite pleased!","

I haven't mastered all of the Echo's capabilities yet, but I am very satisfied with what I have experienced!"
Love it!,"

I'm a big fan!"
I can receive my CPR classical station.  Great sound.What I like least is the learning curve and my mistakes.,"

I can tune in to my favorite CPR classical station, which has great sound quality. The thing I don't like is the steep learning curve and all the mistakes I make while trying to learn."
"Sounds well and we find it useful overall but it can be frustrating when it doesn’t respond or you forget the correct command.  “Alexa, turn on the living room lights”.  Oops I mean “Alexa turn on the family room lights”. I also never realized I call my couch a sofa some times.  Unfortunately my Alexa is confused by my changing names for where I sit.","

Overall, we find Alexa useful, but it can be frustrating when it doesn't respond or when you forget the correct command. For example, you might say ""Alexa, turn on the living room lights"" and then remember you meant ""turn on the family room lights"". Additionally, you may not realize that you sometimes refer to your couch as a sofa, which confuses Alexa."
no it is broke and I can't get help fixing or replacing it,"

It is not working and I am unable to receive assistance in repairing or replacing it."
"I’m still unable to connect any devices although it says it has a built in hub. So bought a bridge to connect the devices thinking that everything would sync and my other devices are still not discovered via my echo plus and I was looking forward to this feature. Being able to play music, check the weather etc is fine.","

Even though my Echo Plus says it has a built-in hub, I still can't seem to connect any devices. So I purchased a bridge to try and get everything synced, but my other devices are still not being detected. I was really hoping this feature would work, but at least I can still use it to play music and check the weather."
sounds great have not used the hub yet,"

That sounds fantastic! I haven't tried out the hub yet."
"Is as expected and more, responds very fast to given commands and was very easy to connect via the Amazon App. I also bought the PhilipsHue Light Bulb and all I had to do was put it in my lamp and tell Alexa to find my device and it connected and the lamp now turns on and off with voice commands.","

The product exceeded my expectations; it reacted quickly to my commands and was simple to set up through the Amazon App. I also purchased the PhilipsHue Light Bulb, and all I had to do was place it in my lamp. Then, I asked Alexa to find my device, and it connected instantly. Now, I can control my lamp with my voice."
Sound is better," than silence

Noise is preferable to quiet."
It is as if we are having a conversation with another person.  Instantaneous response.  And the fact that it catches your command even when you're far from it is simply just amazing.,"

It's like talking to someone in real time, with an immediate answer. The ability to receive your commands from a distance is simply incredible."
Although I haven't taken advantage of many of the Echo's features there is one that bothers me. It starts talking even when I haven't said anything even close to the wake up word - ECHO - had to change from Alexa due to a conflict with another device.,"

Even though I haven't taken advantage of many of the Echo's features, there is one that's been a problem for me. It starts talking even when I haven't said anything that resembles the wake up word, which had to be changed from Alexa to ECHO due to an issue with another device."
The echo plus is very straight forward and easy to use.  It plays great sounding music and can do lots of other things.  Still learning what all it can do.  Working very well so far.,"

The Echo Plus is incredibly user-friendly and provides excellent audio quality. There are many features to explore, and I'm still discovering what it can do. So far, it's been working quite well."
We have used for last 2 weeks. We like it. My children also like it. Alexa has become part of our family.,"

For the past two weeks, we have been using Alexa and have grown to really enjoy it. My kids love it too and Alexa has essentially become a member of our family."
Terrible. Stopped working after one day.,"

Horrible. Ceased functioning after a single day."
"better sound than my echo dot. Simple to set up, less than 5 minutes.","

It's easier to set up than my Echo Dot and the sound quality is superior; the whole process takes less than 5 minutes."
Nice toy to have around!,"

It's a great thing to have in your possession."
"It does not speak in Spanish,,,I bought it for my grandmother to have someone to talk to when I’m not around,,,,,no Spanish!","

I bought it for my grandmother to have someone to converse with when I'm not around, but it does not understand Spanish."
Love all the cool thing I can do!,"

I'm so excited about all the awesome things I can do!"
Great product,"

Fantastic item"
Like it. Still working discovery. Really too soon to fully evaluate. But looking forward to learning and using it.,"

I am enjoying this new discovery I am in the process of uncovering. It is still too early to give a comprehensive evaluation, however, I am looking forward to gaining knowledge on it and putting it to use."
"When I got this Echo I was excited to have a device with better sound than my Dot and a hub to control some Hue bulbs.What I didn't realize and also wasn't fully communicated to me, is that you can't use Hue bulbs to their full potential with this device. You can only turn on and off the lights and set them to a number of preset colors. You also cannot update the bulbs to the newest firmare which is a security concern for me.Do not buy this if you want a full featured hub for your new IoT devices. If you do, you will end up needing to update to a standalone hub, which makes the hub inside this device redundant and pointless.I still love the echo and have zero complaints about the Alexa functionality or sound quality of this device. I'm only disappointed with the hub's functionalities.","

When I bought this Echo, I was thrilled to have a device with better sound than my Dot and a hub to control some Hue bulbs. I had no clue, however, that its hub capabilities were so limited. You can only turn the lights on and off, and set them to pre-determined colors. You also can't update the bulbs to the latest firmware, which is a security issue for me. If you're looking for a hub with full features for your new IoT devices, I'd advise against buying this Echo. You'll end up needing to buy a separate hub, making the one in this device redundant and pointless. I still like the Echo, and I'm very satisfied with the Alexa functionality and sound quality. The only problem I have is with the hub's functionalities."
Still needs some work on commands. Sound is equal in the regular echo so if you don't need a smart hub get a regular echo. The sound is ok with it had as much bass as my old soundlink but I mean hey gets loud on the treble and sounds clear.,"

The regular Echo is not bad in terms of sound, so if you don't need a smart hub, you can go with the regular Echo. Although it doesn't have as much bass as my old Soundlink, the treble gets loud and the sound is clear."
"I love my echo plus. I use it with my Spotify account, to find my phone, make phone calls,  turn our lights off and on, much more. Most importantly it reads story to my children.  They love it and that makes me happy.","

I am very fond of my Echo Plus. It has been extremely helpful for me in a variety of ways, such as connecting to my Spotify account, locating my phone, making phone calls, and even controlling the lights. But the best part is that it reads stories to my children, which brings me immense joy."
Excellent why didn’t I think it is in the beginning I love it,"

I'm so glad I figured it out - I love it!"
"Bye bye Philips hub and expensive monthly internet charge!  Took a little tinkering, had to rest the individual bulbs, but works great! No more, &#34;Philips hue bridge is not responding&#34; message.","

Say goodbye to the Philips hub and those costly monthly internet fees! After some tinkering and resetting of the individual bulbs, it's working perfectly! You won't see the ""Philips hue bridge is not responding"" message anymore."
"Works great! Exactly as described. Only complaint I have is sometimes Alexa gets confused with smart home product names and i had to go back and change some stuff around, but i chalk that up to my inexperience with smart home stuff.","

This product works as expected and is great overall. The only issue I had was that Alexa occasionally had trouble recognizing the names of certain smart home products, so I had to make some adjustments, but I think that was due to my lack of experience with this type of technology."
I love it. Use it mostly for the music huge repertoire to choose from,"

I am really fond of it, especially due to the massive selection of music it offers."
Very easy to hook up. Download the app and it walks you through the setup,"

It's a breeze to get connected. Just download the app and it will guide you through the installation process."
"I am so disappointed in this product.  I tried to install two different units and neither one of them were successfully completed.  Hours with Amazon technicians.. resetting each of them.  The app didn't connect the Echo Plus to the internet connection.  Tried using the application on a phone, a tablet and on a Chromebook... No luck.  There are no clean directions on the application.  Probably sending this back to Amazon..mark this as Not ready for prime time.","

I am extremely dissatisfied with this product. I attempted to set up two separate models, but neither of them worked even after countless hours spent with Amazon's tech support and resetting the units. The app failed to connect the Echo Plus to the internet, and I unsuccessfully tried using it on a phone, a tablet and a Chromebook. Furthermore, the instructions included were unclear and unhelpful. I think I'll be returning this product - it's definitely not ready for prime time."
Well behaved device that i enjoy using.,"

A device that I find enjoyable to use and is well-mannered."
Easy setup and sound quality.,"

Quick and simple installation process with great audio quality."
I really love the hub feature,"

I'm a huge fan of the hub function."
What a blast!  We love Echo...  Just learning all the tricks but lots of fun and helpful too!,"

We are having a great time with Echo! We are still learning all the different things that it can do, but it is really enjoyable and useful!"
Love this!,"

I am absolutely fond of this!"
"Great sound quality, works well with smart home devices","

The audio is of high quality and is compatible with smart home systems."
Use way more often than we used our Google Home.,"

We should utilize our Google Home much more frequently."
"Mic hears everything but only understands about half the first time, it often takes multiple tries until it gives the correct result.","

Mic picks up on all sounds, but only comprehends around half of them initially; it usually takes several attempts before it provides the right answer."
"Nice add on to a home.What I don't like are the limitations, for example world soccer. It won't give you much info of sport teams other than American.","

I don't care for the restrictions that come with it, like not being able to get much information about teams from outside the U.S. when it comes to world soccer."
"I was a little apprehensive about buying this because I saw reviews saying it sounds like crap. I'm no audiophile by any means so maybe it's that, but I think it sounds great considering the size. It fills my living room with sound and gets pretty loud while remaining clear. I haven't had any issues pairing with my devices or utilizing any of the voice commands. I have it paired to an EcoBee3, my Firestick, and a Phillip's Hue light bulb. I plan on adding devices as I go. I love this thing and I'm glad I scooped it up! I have only had it around 2 weeks. Will update if I run into issues.","

I was slightly worried when I bought this item after reading reviews that said the sound was terrible, but since I'm not an audio expert, I think it sounds great for its size. It can fill up my living room with sound and get loud without becoming distorted. Connecting it to my EcoBee3, Firestick, and Phillip's Hue light bulb was easy, and I plan to add more devices in the future. I'm really happy I got this and so far I haven't had any problems. I've only had it for two weeks, so I'll update if I have any issues."
I love my Echo Plus. The only drawback is that there is no battery so it has to be plugged in at all times which makes it inconvenient  to use outdoors.,"

I adore my Echo Plus, but the downside is that it doesn't have a battery, so it needs to be plugged in constantly, which makes it difficult to take it outdoors."
"Great device, my grandkids had a ball setting it up for me!","

My grandkids had a blast helping me get this amazing gadget set up!"
The alexa is awesome but when i rcieved the light buld i did not know that u need another adapter to have the light buld to work. I was not aware of that.  Disappointed,"

I was surprised to find out that I needed an additional adapter in order to make the light bulb I received work with my Alexa. I had not been aware of this beforehand and was quite disappointed."
"The Echo Plus is great! So easy to set up and with the built in hub, it connects to other Alexa devices with a mere verbal command. I am 62 and not super techno knowledgable but this was easy for me. Have my lights integrated with Alexa and now looking at security cameras and locks. Definitely recommend the Echo Plus!","

I'm 62 and not very tech-savvy, but setting up the Echo Plus was a breeze! It has a built-in hub that allows it to connect to other Alexa devices with just a voice command. I have my lights synced up with Alexa, and I'm now looking into security cameras and locks. I highly recommend the Echo Plus!"
Works as advertised! It says Alexa is always learning. That's great because I am just learning all the things Alexa can do.,"

It seems that Alexa is living up to its promise; it is constantly evolving and improving, which is great for me since I am still learning about all of its capabilities."
"Great , love it.","

I'm really enjoying this."
wish it had a battery or was described better as a plug in only item.,"

I wish it was either battery-powered or more clearly stated that it is a plug-in only item."
Doesn't seem to hear as well as my 2nd Generation Echo and WHY is there no volume buttons on it?!,"

It doesn't appear to be as sensitive to sound as my 2nd Generation Echo, and why is there no way to adjust the volume?"
A+,"

I think it is necessary to take action.

I believe it is essential to take steps."
Worked great. The built in hub works great.,"

The integrated hub functions excellently."
It knows everything  we ask it to do. Havent smart hubbed it yet but does exactly as advertised and am very happy with our purchase. Sound quality is excellent also,"

The smart hub is yet to be implemented, but it does exactly what it is advertised to do and we are very pleased with our purchase. The sound quality is also great."
"Connecting and sound are perfect! I only give 4 because the is no internal battery, if I disconnect to the power source, it will be off.","

I'm only giving the connection and sound a 4 out of 5 because there is no internal battery, so if I unplug it, it will turn off."
"It seems easy to stump Alexa with rather simple questions that are easily googled with the correct answer.  We admit that we have not explored all that's available through the Echo.  One irritating issue is that Alexa cannot answer help questions concerning how to use the system, rather it refers you to the Alexa app or help via a computer.  It was very simple to setup and use and we continue to learn how this tool can become more useful.","

We found it quite easy to ask Alexa questions that were easily answered with a simple Google search. We haven't tried out all the features that the Echo has to offer yet. One downside is that Alexa cannot answer questions about how to use the system, instead it directs you to the Alexa app or to the help page online. Setting up the Echo was a breeze and we are still learning more about how this tool can be of use."
I like how easy it was to set up. Very easy to use and set up with other Bluetooth devices.,"

I appreciate how straightforward it was to get up and running. It was simple to utilize and connect with other Bluetooth gadgets."
Ease of use and many tasks it will perform,"

The simplicity of the interface and the multitude of functions it can perform."
"I purchased the Echo Plus with built-in hub during Prime Days sale. It was delivered very fast and was easy to link to my WiFi. Also connected it to a smart plug to control a light. I love telling Alexa to play music, and she hears me from 2 rooms away. Excited to learn new uses for it.","

I bought the Echo Plus with an integrated hub during Prime Days and it arrived quickly. Setting it up to my WiFi was a breeze, and I was able to connect it to a smart plug to control a light. I'm delighted that I can ask Alexa to play music from two rooms away and I'm eager to discover new ways to use it."
"It was harder to setup then I thought it should be, for some reason I had to default  it twice. Had to go thru too many steps to setup and find my devices. Would be nice if it could interact with my Xfinity cable tv cable box and it also does not work with my Xfinity alarm for my house or my cameras, be nice set and disarm the alarm with Alexa. Had to install a skill app to setup bulb ??? whats that about, you ship it with your product ??? should have said (Alexa setup bulb) or (Alexa find new bulb) ??? and (Alexa setup Nest)??? it's fine that you use third party apps but Alexa should do the work for you.","

Setting up the product was more difficult than I anticipated, and I had to reset it twice. There were too many steps involved and I couldn't find my devices. It would be great if it could work with my Xfinity cable box, alarm, and cameras. It would be nice if Alexa could set up the bulb and Nest without having to use a third-party app. It would be helpful if the instructions said to say ""Alexa set up bulb"" or ""Alexa find new bulb"" and ""Alexa set up Nest"" instead."
Nothing to dislike I love my new toy that has made my house a smart home.,"

I have no complaints about my new toy that has made my house a smart home; I absolutely love it."
The built in hub lacks some of the features (geo fencing) of the Phillips hub.  Otherwise would have given it 5 stars.,"

If the built in hub had the same features as the Phillips hub, including geo fencing, it would have gotten five stars from me."
The Echo Plus is used for leisure and pleasure. I absolutely love it. Easy to set up and connect. What a great addition to my listening pleasure. I have not used it yet for other purposes.,"

I'm absolutely in love with the Echo Plus! It was so simple to set up and connect, and it has been such a great addition to my leisure activities. I haven't used it for anything else yet, but I'm sure I will soon."

The echo part works fine.  The hue hub is a disaster.  It worked for a few months and then nothing.  I spent 2 hours on the phone with tech support one =y to have to send it in for repair.  I am now trying to reconnect my lights.  What a pain.  I am having to reset each light bulb.  It can take up to 5 times to get it to reset.  I have spent hours on this.  I will say customer service was friendly and tried to be helpful.  Stick with the echo and smart plugs for lamps.,"

The Echo is great, but the Hue Hub was a total nightmare. It worked for a few months, then stopped working. I spent two hours on the phone with tech support and eventually had to send it in for repair. Now I'm in the process of reconnecting my lights, which has been a huge hassle. I have to reset each bulb, and it can take up to five times before it's successful. I've spent hours on this. The customer service has been friendly and tried to be helpful, but I'd recommend sticking with the Echo and smart plugs for lamps."
I love it and my family loves it also we use it all the time we also like playing the games that you can get on it too!! Great for family game nights,"

My family and I adore it and use it frequently. We also enjoy the games that can be found on it, making it ideal for family game nights!"
It was supposed to come with a free Hue lightbulb on Amazon Prime Day.  No light bulb arrived.  False advertising!,"

I was expecting to receive a free Hue lightbulb on Amazon Prime Day, but no such item was included. This is clearly deceptive advertising!"

"This is the 3rd unit I purchased all the way from gen 1 to the plus. The only reason I purchased this is because it works so well and I wanted it in other rooms as well. All my switches work great and I have had not issues. I the past, I did have some ghost commands when Alexa would answer a question when no one asked her to but I think some recent ipdates May have resolved this. It just keeps improving over time, not with call capabilities. I work with adapting smart homes and this is by far the cheapest, best way so far. Can’t wait to see what they come up with next.","

I bought my third unit of this series, from the original to the Plus, because it operates so well. I'm using it in multiple rooms and haven't had any problems. There were some times when Alexa would respond to a question that wasn't asked, but I think recent updates may have fixed this. It's been getting better and better, even without voice control. I'm in the business of setting up smart homes and this is the most cost-effective and reliable option I've seen so far. I'm eager to see what they come up with next."
Love it. I play music everyday and voice  activated makes it so easy,"

I really enjoy playing music every day and the voice activated feature makes it incredibly convenient."
I can't get multiple profiles working. It just spins when adding a 2nd user at pass device prompt,"

No problems whatsoever makes life easy and sounds great.,"

There are no issues at all that make life simpler and sound amazing."
"This is a very useful device.  I use it to turn my lights on and off around the house.  It works with all the other Alexa devices, so I can give a command near any of them, and this will process the request.  It also handles all the functions that the other devices can do. I enjoy it much more than I thought I would.","

This device has been incredibly helpful for me. I use it to control the lights in my house with just my voice. It's compatible with all the other Alexa devices, so I can give a command from any of them and it will respond. It's also capable of doing all the same things that the other devices can do. Surprisingly, I'm really enjoying it."
I love my echo plus!!!,"

I am a huge fan of my Echo Plus!"
"How can you not like the Echo Plus.  It has the built in Hub and works seamlessly with all my compatible devices.  Amazon makes a great product and I haven't had a single issue with this one or any of the other devices (echo dots, etc.).","

It's hard to find something not to like about the Echo Plus. It comes with a built-in Hub and functions perfectly with all my compatible devices. Amazon consistently produces excellent products, and I haven't had a single problem with any of the Echo devices I've used (Echo Dots, etc.)."
"I have been hesitant to purchase anything smart home because I am just not good with electronics.  However this surprised me how easy it is to set up and it links to the Bluetooth in my sound bar for my TV which provides extra sound for music, I can make calls and finally hear people when home. I do not have cable, only the paid apps like Netflix and Hulu so when Alexa provided me news stations, weather and other updates it was really great to hear! I have linked all of my accounts to her, she turns on my lights before I walk through the door. She purchases re-orders off of Amazon for my pets and I heard if something bad happened at your home she would place a call to 911 regardless if she was unplugged or not.  This is important as an extra layer of protection for someone living alone.  My tech savvy bf went out and bought her after a week of me having her. Must buy!!!","

I was initially hesitant to purchase any smart home devices because I'm not very tech-savvy. However, I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to set up and link it to my sound bar. With it, I can make calls, hear people better when I'm at home, and get access to news, weather, and other updates without needing cable. I've even linked all my accounts to it, and it turns on my lights before I get home. It even orders re-supplies for my pets on Amazon, and I've heard that it can call 911 even if it's unplugged. This is really important for someone living alone, as it provides an extra layer of protection. After a week of me having it, my tech-savvy boyfriend went out and bought one too. Definitely worth it!"

"I'll be returning it.  It's been nothing but annoying.  The hub can't be turned off if not needed and it interferes with my Hue Bridge.  I can't even install Philips lights with it unless I unplug it to do so.  There are plenty of other reviews that go in depth with the issues.  Bottom line is it sucks as a hub.  It doesn't support z-wave and zigbee (which in fairness I knew in advance), but when the one protocol it does support doesn't do many functions that a dedicated one will, what's the point?  I noticed right away that my Philips Hue Bridge supports firmware upgrades to the light bulbs themselves and this doesn't.  I found that rather interesting.","

"Works great I bought this Direct from amazon, and I have got to tell you, This item Echo Show and Echo Plus is the best item I have ever had and I am kind of a tech geek. I am a disabled person, and it helps me turn light on and off, and schedule doctor appointments, using google voice phone, and get my medical rides to and from hospitals, plays music on cue from multiple web apps, and watch videos, as well as communicating to my Nurses aide my schedule and calendar of events. I wish there were programs that helped disabled people get these and smart lights. They are literally the best items since chocolate to assist the disabled and literally anybody else who need them. Although the echo show is not a hub once you set up the Echo plus hub with your lights you can use any amazon device to shut the lights off. Thank God, no more working my ass off to turn on or off lights. Thank you Amazon. I will save up enough money to buy more gift cards from Affirm.com to purchase 1 more of each and some lights for rest of the house. Jeff Bezos these are awesome items and because of your allowing me to get amazon prime at a lower cost due to disability I was finally able to buy these items on your prime day event. really helped when all you earn a month is $672 on SSDI thank you all again.","

"I'm sure the Echo is as cool as everyone says....but I won't get to try this one. Even though I have a Large covered porch.....the package was left on my top step on a day forecast for 100% chance of rain.....and rain it did, soaking the package. I'm not even going to open it and see how bad the damage is. This order has been cursed from the beginning. Ordered as a Birthday Gift and Delivery was not made on scheduled day. Now I get it, and its rain-soaked.","

I'm sure the Echo is as amazing as everyone says, but I won't be able to experience it for myself. I have a big porch, yet the package was left on the top step on a day when the forecast showed a 100% chance of rain - and, as expected, it rained heavily and soaked the package. I'm not even going to open it and check the extent of the damage. This order has been jinxed from the start - it was bought as a birthday present and it didn't arrive on the scheduled date. And now, after all that, I get it and it's wet from the rain."

"We are a long time Amazon Prime family, many years, but new to the Alexa world and thought the purchase of Alexa Plus, with hub, and included Phillips Hue light bulb would be a great start. Alexa does a lot of good things for us like Alarm in the morning, verbalize books, playing music on command, even linked to my Sirrius/xm account. Good daily stuff. Good sound, but not Bose. But, the ads say &#34;Hub included&#34; so don't need anything else to operate devices. Well, not so. I understand there will be some differences in product device  support. The fact that it came with the Hue light bulb works only for on /off/ dimming of the bulb. The bulb is capable of so much more with the Hue App but the Hue app does not recognize Alexa hub as a bridge. So, it appears you do have to get a Philips bridge to set the bulbs for scenes, time the lights when you are away, set color tones, etc. That can all be done via internet with your phone or tablet away from home. The list goes on for its capabilities but not without its own bridge. Was very disappointed to find that out after the fact, to the point I feel we are being misled by Amazon by included the Hue bulbs without explanation. Maybe throw a good discount my way to get the Hue bridge if I keep the Echo Plus before I invest in more light bulbs.","

We have been a part of the Amazon Prime family for many years, but are new to the Alexa world. We thought that purchasing the Alexa Plus with the hub and Phillips Hue light bulb would be a great start. Alexa does a lot of helpful things for us such as setting alarms, reading books aloud, playing music on command, and linking to our Sirius/XM account. The ads say that the hub is included, so we assumed that we wouldn't need anything else to operate our devices. However, we soon discovered that this was not the case. We understand that there are differences in product device support, but the Hue light bulb only works for turning it on/off and dimming it. The Hue app can do so much more, but it does not recognize the Alexa hub as a bridge. Therefore, we have to purchase a Philips bridge to set the bulbs for scenes, time the lights when we are away, set color tones, and more. We are very disappointed that this was not made clear before we bought the Echo Plus and feel that Amazon is misleading customers by including the Hue bulbs without explanation. We would appreciate it if Amazon offered us a discount to purchase the Hue bridge if we keep the Echo Plus before we invest in more light bulbs."

I purchased this product on Prime Day and saved a lot of money. I have three large Bluetooth speakers in my house that I have been using for a while, but the Echo Plus was louder than all three of them at the same time. I was very impressed with its clarity and volume. Unfortunately, you need a paid subscription to some kind of streaming audio service in order to get the most out of the device. It will play Pandora and Spotify, but you're limited in terms of skips and song selection without a subscription. Additionally, it does not support YouTube music or audio. Apple users may be disappointed to see that it's not as convenient as an Apple device. Despite this, I still enjoyed the device, but I'm going to get the DOT instead which has an audio out jack (as does the Echo Plus) and I can just connect it to external speakers."
"I have been thinking about getting this for a long time and was excited when it arrived bundled with a Philip Hue bulb.  The excited ended quickly.  I spend about a total of 4 hours attempting to add this bulb to my Alexa Echo Plus.  Everything I tried, ended in a Discovery Failed message.  I tried to set this up over and over and over again.  I watched YouTube videos.  I read set up websites.  I was the poster child of insanity (doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results).The next day I went onto Amazon to get the tech support.  I was hoping something would be done to make this thing work, but also the problem not being operator error.  Well after 3 tech support staff and 1 hr. and 19 mins. of being on the phone, it still didn't work.  This product has tested my patience.  So far this experience is shifting my mindset from going to a smart home to just kicking it old school.The only reason I gave this two stars is because Amazon will be sending me a different Echo Plus and light bulb.  The problem wasn't the bulb, because before packing up the items, I purchased another bulb and still Alexa couldn't locate this device.I pray the next attempt is successful and then I will revise this rating, but what are the odds that I was shipped a defective Echo?  The support person had the same thought.  Maybe I should be exploring the Google device but I can't get over the look of that hub.  It looks like a defuser.I can't believe I didn't find YouTube videos that show the problems I did.  Everything looked simple and seamless...NOT the experience I had.  OK, I'm done with this review because I spend enough wasted time this weekend already.","

I have been wanting this product for a while, so I was ecstatic when it came with a Philip Hue bulb.

After speaking with three tech support staff for an hour and nineteen minutes, it still didn't work. This product has truly tested my patience. I gave it two stars because Amazon is sending me a different Echo Plus and light bulb, but I'm skeptical that I was shipped a defective Echo.

Sounds a little better than the original plus it now has an interrogated Zigbee hub.  The hub is compatible with the GE Link bulbs.,"

The GE Link bulbs are now compatible with an interrogated Zigbee hub that is even better than before."
"I got it to try side by side with the Echo originale. They are essentially the same in dimension, weight and the woofer is the same save for the smaller tweeter point up instead of down and the built in hub. As many folks already pointed out, the hub is not a direct replacement for the Philips Hue, Z wave or anything else. It provides a sub set of features available from the stand alone hub and you ended up losing functionality that you took for granted on the dedicated hub. For me, the voice recognition and music play capability is the same, the original Echo may have an edge on the volume department due to larger speakers. The new Echo plus is priced lower than the original Echo with the built in hub but I don't really need the hub with less functionality. In addition, I don't think that Amazon will have software updates for this hub as other dedicated hub would have so bugs could end up never fixed. My Philips hub gets software update probably once every couple months and it keeps up with the changes in the new bulbs FW and they fixes bugs. Net net for me, this Echo does not do anything more than the original Echo and sound quality is not as good. With the  original Echo available as refurbished I would check that out first before considering this or the new Echo which is clearly inferior to both of these.","

I compared the Echo Plus and the original Echo side by side and found that they were essentially the same in terms of size, weight, and the woofer. The Plus has a smaller tweeter that points up instead of down and has a built-in hub, but it doesn't offer the same features as the dedicated Philips Hue, Z wave, or other hubs. The voice recognition and music play capabilities are the same, but the original Echo may have better sound quality due to its larger speakers. The Echo Plus is cheaper than the original Echo, but I don't need the hub and it doesn't offer the same features. Also, Amazon may not provide software updates for this hub like other dedicated hubs, so any bugs may never be fixed. The original Echo is available as refurbished, so I would look into that before considering the Echo Plus or the new Echo, which is inferior to both of these."
"Why do we need to buy a $100 hub to get it to work with Samsung TV's and many other devices?  I want my money back!  This thing won't even turn on my TV unless I buy another hub.  What's the point of having a hub that doesn't support half the devices out there?  DON'T buy this thing unless you want to spend another $100 on another hub.  It won't work with many of your devices.  Just by the Echo or Dot if you must but not this.  Better yet, get a Google device.  They actually understand you when you talk.","

I would not recommend purchasing this $100 hub if you want it to work with Samsung TV's and many other devices. You'll end up spending another $100 on a different hub just for it to work. Save yourself the money and aggravation and get an Echo or Dot, or even better, a Google device. They will actually understand you when you talk."

I am fond of having it in my living room."

"I only purchase the echo plus because it has a built in hub and came with the free philips hue bulb.  When I got everything set up, I realized the echo plus hub won’t allow full functionality of the bulb.  All it does is turn the light on/off and dim.  It will not change colors.  You still have to have a Hue Bridge to have full function of all the features of the bulb.  I wish I’d bought the bulb and bridge separately to use with the echo I already had since the built in hub on this echo will essentially be useless and I’ll have to buy the hue bridge to get the full benefit of the lights.","

I decided to buy the Echo Plus because it has an integrated hub and came with a free Philips Hue bulb. After I got everything set up, however, I found out that the Echo Plus hub won't let me use all the features of the bulb; it only allows me to turn it on/off and dim it. To get the full range of features, I would need to buy a Hue Bridge separately. I regret not buying the bulb and bridge separately to use with my Echo, as the built-in hub on the Echo Plus is essentially useless and I have to buy the Hue Bridge anyway to get the full benefit of the lights."
"At a volume setting of half or less, the speaker sounds like there is something rattling, crackling or vibrating in it.  I'd understand if the volume was set higher.  All speakers get distorted when over-driven.  But this doesn't sound like this is an over-driven case; sounds like more of a rattle/crackle.  Possibly because the bass is too high.  Learned that there is no ability to adjust any of the sound characteristics (other than volume).  I will attempt to exchange it assuming it is just an isolated problem.","

When the volume is set to half or less, the speaker makes a rattling, crackling, or vibrating noise. I would expect this if the volume was set too high, but this doesn't seem to be the case.

I will try to exchange the speaker, in case this is an isolated problem."

"Alexa helps with more than just lights or music, it helps out when your kids think they know everything and you know nothing  lol  Sweet  love it  so much so I purchased 2, Alexa has been a great purchase for my uncle whom lives by himself, when I got it he wasnt so keen on it, but now its his best friend, he tells her goodmorning and she will say it back along with a description on something that is happening today or something special that happened years ago on that day, as well as sang him Happy birthday  lolol  he now has educated him self on things he never knew, and laughs at the things she may say when he waits to see he response to something hes asked  love it, and to think I was going to hate it.","

My uncle was initially not thrilled when I got him an Alexa, but it has since become his best friend. He greets Alexa with a ""good morning"" and she responds with either a description of something happening today or a memory from years ago. He's also learned new things and laughs at the responses Alexa gives to his questions. I was initially going to dislike it, but Alexa has been a great purchase."
"Incredible piece of technology.I have this right center of my living room on an island kitchen counter. The mic and speaker goes in every direction and the quality of the sound is quite good. I connected the Echo via Bluetooth to my Sony soundbar on my TV but find the Echo placement and 360 sound more appealing. It's no audiophile equipment but there is good range and decent bass. The sound is more than adequate for any indoor entertaining and loud enough to bother neighbors in my building. The knob on the top works great for adjusting volume. This is my first Echo device and I would imagine having to press volume buttons (on the Echo 2) a large inconvenience and not as precise. For that alone I would recommend this over the regular Echo (2nd generation).The piece looks quality and is quite sturdy with some weight on it. The rubber material on the bottom has a good grip on the granite counter-- my cat can even rub her scent on it without tipping it over.This order came with a free Philips Hue Bulb which I installed along with an extra one I bought. I put the 2 bulbs into my living room floor lamp, turned on the light, and all I had to do was say &#34;Alexa, connect my devices&#34;. The default names for each bulb was assigned as &#34;First light&#34; and &#34;Second light&#34;, so I can have a dimmer floor lamp if I just turned on/off one of the lights by saying &#34;Alexa, turn off the second light&#34;. In the Alexa app, I created a 'Group' with &#34;First light&#34; and &#34;Second light&#34; and named the group &#34;The light&#34;, so to turn on the lamp with both bulbs shining I just say &#34;Alexa, turn on The light&#34;.I was surprised how easily the bulbs connected to the Echo Plus with its built in hub. I thought I would have to buy a hub bridge to connect to my floor lamp power plug. Apparently there is some technology built directly inside the bulb! I was surprised by that. Awesome.You will feel like Tony Stark on this device. I added quite a few &#34;Skills&#34; like 'Thunderstorm sounds' and 'Quote of the day' . Alexa always loads them up quickly. Adding songs that you hear to specific playlists on Amazon Music is also a great feature.I can go on and on and this is only my second day of ownership.I was lucky to buy this for $100 on Prime Day, but I think for $150 is it pretty expensive considering the Echo 2 is only $100. In my opinion, you will be paying a premium for the Echo Plus and you have to decide if the value is there for you:1) Taller and 360 sound unit.2) Volume knob on top that you spin (I think this is a huge benefit over buttons)3) Built in hub for Hue bulbs. After researching more, there are some cons to this setup if you plan on having more advanced light setups. For me and my floor lamp, it's just perfect.I highly recommend it and will buy an Echo dot for my bedroom now.","This amazing piece of technology is the Echo Plus, which I have in the middle of my living room on a kitchen counter. The sound quality is great, with a good range and decent bass, and the volume knob on the top makes adjusting it very precise. It's sturdy and looks great, and also came with a free Philips Hue Bulb. Connecting the bulbs was easy and I can control them with just my voice. There are lots of features, like adding songs to Amazon Music playlists, and I think it's worth the $150 price tag. I highly recommend it and am now looking at getting an Echo Dot for my bedroom."

"I would like to tell you that I have a reason to hate it like the speakers suck, or the color, or the shape or even the way it smells, but I can honestly say the number reason I hate this device is I have tried to set it up 3x's now to no avail, I have 4 other Echo devices already that I set up and use quite regularly, I have reset my phone (Galaxy S8), checked the app for updates, I have cycled power to the Echo unit with each attempt. I work in the network/technology industry for a living and have for over 20 years now, so lack of experience or knowledge is not the problem here. I used the app and the device even tells me it is connected and to follow the app to continue set up, the set up screen just continues to roll the 3 dots around the screen for about 5 minutes before the app locks up on my phone and I have to force the app to close, restart my phone and the Echo and try again. I figured 3x's was enough, it shouldn't be that hard a techie, I can only imagine how bad this will prove to be for people whom have no clue about technology....I hope they won't call me I'll tell em to send the product back!","

"Pros- plenty loud for a large room with high ceilings.Cons - the hub doesn’t do anything.  It doesn’t work with z wave (as it states), it doesn’t take voice commands for SmartThings, which I had to buy since the hub doesn’t work for z wave.It also sounds muffled and there is no way to control the EQ. (Not sure if that is on all models, but the Dots we have are clear.For the money, buy an echo dot or echo (2nd generation).  The echo dot takes voice commands for the smart things hub, go figure, and the audio is clear. The dot also seems to hear my voice better and almost at a whisper.","

The pros of this product are that it is loud enough for a large room with high ceilings. The cons are that the hub doesn't do anything and cannot be used with z wave, as stated. It also doesn't take voice commands for SmartThings, which means you have to buy a separate hub. Additionally, the sound is muffled and there is no way to control the equalizer. For the money, it is better to buy an Echo Dot or Echo (2nd Generation). The Echo Dot takes voice commands for the SmartThings hub and has clearer audio. It also seems to pick up voices better, even at a whisper."
"Alexa is a decent speaker if that's all you need. She is terrible at most other things. She consistently answers questions that were not asked or says &#34;hmmm I don't know that&#34; for everything else. We've gone back to just using our phones because she can't really look anything up. Pretty much everyone makes fun of me for spending money on this when I had an awesome Bose bluetooth already. I bought her because my mother (who lives alone) uses hers a lot and is happy with it, but we have a full house with kids and I'm less than impressed. I'd never recommend it to anyone except for senior citizens who love alone and need to be able to shout out for help in the event of a fall.","

If you're only looking for a speaker, Alexa is decent. However, she fails at most other tasks and often responds to questions that weren't asked, or says ""hmmm I don't know that"" for everything else.

"Was debating between a 4 and a 5 star review. The one challenge with the hub is that Phillips has added functionality that only works with their hub. Basic functionality works with this unit, but now I need two apps to set everything how I want it instead of one, which has caused some user issues. It's woken up a couple times without the trigger word, which I find highly unsettling. We have minor issues with it not always picking up what we say correctly, but it's usually just one or two repeats if that happens.The speaker is great quality and easily covers the kitchen/living room. The sleek design is not obtrusive. My girlfriend has had fun interacting with it and we've had entertaining conversations with it.","

I was torn between giving the hub a 4 or a 5 star review. The main issue with it is that Phillips has added features that only work with their own hub, so I now need two apps to get everything set up the way I want it, which has been causing some problems. It has also woken up without the trigger word a couple of times, which I find quite alarming. There are minor issues with it not always understanding what we are saying, but usually it just needs to hear us repeat ourselves once or twice. The sound quality is great and it easily covers the kitchen and living room area. The design is also very attractive and does not stand out too much. My girlfriend has been having a lot of fun interacting with it, and we have had some hilarious conversations."

I really like this item. I already had the echo dot but with this purchase the Philips Hue bulb came with the plus.

The plus is in our great room/kitchen area. So far I give this a 5 star.,"

I'm really enjoying this item; I already had an Echo Dot, but when I purchased the Philips Hue bulb, it came with the Plus.

"I am the Training Coordinator at my company and I have used the Amazon Blueprints skill with an Echo device and Echo Buttons to create my own Gameshow/Quiz for new hire orientation training. I'm always looking for new ways to engage trainees in order to make learning more enjoyable. I believe that if someone enjoys the process of learning then they're much more likely to remember the information. So far, this has been a huge success with my classes and I look forward to Amazon improving and building out the Blueprints skill further!","

"This is a great tool (toy?), room-filling music, very convenient to use, just fun to have. Why only 4 stars? Supposed to work with Logitech Harmony remote: nope. Supposed to work with Denon AV receivers: nope. This may not be Amazon't fault, but advertised skills should actually work. We also have the Echo Show, and the Ring skill works correctly with that device when we want to see who is at the front door.","

This is an awesome piece of equipment that provides great sound in any room. It's very user-friendly and just plain fun to have. Unfortunately, it only gets 4 stars because it doesn't work with Logitech Harmony remote or Denon AV receivers, despite being advertised as compatible. It's possible this isn't Amazon's fault, but the advertised features should actually work. We have an Echo Show and the Ring skill works perfectly on it, allowing us to see who is at the front door."

I really appreciate the convenience of the Echo Plus, as I don't need to bother with CDs and can just ask it to play music.

The Echo has good sound quality and is great for its purpose, but as a smart home hub it is inadequate. It does not have automation, geo-fencing, music syncing for hue, or z-wave.

"Got this a few months ago with the idea that it will help control my smart bulbs and be useful with answering questions and getting daily weather updates.It’s far from being useful.Half the time when you “wake” the device to ask a question or initiate a command, it doesn’t hear what you say and turns off. Basically ignoring you. Often she is unable to answer basic questions.It’s been so frustrating. Alexa has been more work rather than making my life easier.I would return it but I’m past the return period...... zzzz","

I purchased Alexa a few months ago in the hopes that it would help me control my smart bulbs and provide me with daily weather updates and answer questions. Unfortunately, it has been anything but useful. Whenever I try to wake the device to ask a question or issue a command, it often fails to hear me and shuts off, as if it is ignoring me. Even when it does hear me, it is unable to answer basic questions. It has been incredibly frustrating to use and has not made my life easier at all. Sadly, I am now beyond the return period, so I can't get my money back."

Works very well for Amazon and Netflix but will not a let all viewing platforms like VUDU. It also will shut down if HULU is played for more than a couple minutes and yes I have it directly plugged into the wall so low power source is not an issue (even checked outlet voltage) an issue which is typically the answer you get for that issue.over all the quality of the picture is quiet well and is a user friendly platform to use If they would fix those two issues I would have one on every tv in the house but as it sits this will be our only one. to bad to because I relay like amazon products and having Alexa is always nice,"

This product works great for Amazon and Netflix but it won't allow access to other streaming services like VUDU. It also shuts down if HULU is used for more than a few minutes, even when plugged directly into the wall and the voltage checked.

"Recently cut the cord on cable television. Needed an easy to install and relatively inexpensive alternative option to fill the gap. Ordered the Amazon Fire Stick from Best Buy. Instructions were short and easy to follow. I was going to order the Amazon Ethernet Adapter because I was worried about wireless speeds in my area, but thought I'd wait and see. Glad I did. Wireless connection has proved almost flawless so far. A few brief hiccups here and there, but I'm convinced that was from the Apps themselves. Don't miss the ridiculously high cable prices and am able to watch most of what I used to watch for a much lower price, which right now is a total of $50 a month. Amazon Fire Stick is limited to 1GB of memory and 8GB of storage. Thought that would be a huge issue when it came to downloading Apps and recording shows. So far it hasn't been any issue at all. The upcoming fall tv schedule, which includes the return of NFL Football, might prove more troublesome when I need to record more often. I'll worry about that then. My only real issue is that you can't really turn it off. The screen remains on and uses up electricity, although probably small amounts. Luckily when you unplug it, all downloaded Apps and recorded shows stay in memory. Not sure what happens when you have something scheduled to record when it's unplugged. Haven't tried it yet, although I don't think it'll be an issue with DirectTV Now, which I'm using right now. So far I'm loving the Amazon Fire Stick. Actually love that Amazon, which I use occasionally, come pre-installed.","

I recently stopped my cable service and was looking for an easy and cost-effective replacement. I ordered an Amazon Fire Stick from Best Buy and the instructions were simple to follow. I was initially going to order an Amazon Ethernet Adapter due to worries about the wireless speeds in my area, but I decided to wait and see. It has worked well thus far, with only a few minor hiccups. I'm now paying only $50 a month for the same content I used to get from cable at an exorbitant price. I was concerned about the 1GB of memory and 8GB of storage but it hasn't been a problem yet. I'm a bit worried about the upcoming fall tv schedule, when I'll need to record more often. The only downside to the Fire Stick is that the screen is always on, using electricity. However, when unplugged, all downloaded Apps and recorded shows remain in memory. I'm not sure what happens if something is scheduled to record when it's unplugged, but I haven't tried it yet. I'm pleased with the Amazon Fire Stick so far, especially since Amazon is already pre-installed."

Channels work just fine like Apple TV, just need to check if there is a phone app for a keyboard typing, because spelling things out on keyboard sucks for searching YouTube clips","

I don't have an Alexa yet, but this experience has made me want to get one. This seems to be a great way to test out Alexa, and I'm really enjoying it. The channels work well, like Apple TV, though I'm not sure if there is an app that allows you to type on a keyboard. It's really annoying having to spell out words when searching for YouTube clips."

I had to send the device back because Hulu didn't work properly on it. It would display errors, and occasionally the Hulu app wouldn't even open.

The Firestick we were sent was completely unusable; even the voice remote wouldn't turn on. We tried all the troubleshooting steps, but to no avail.

"It's constantly buffering, to the point where you can't watch anything without interruption. I purchased on Prime Day plus I used rewards to pay for it, so in the end I paid next to nothing. If I had paid full price for it I might want my money back. We stopped trying to use it and went back to our old streaming device. I know our internet service is not the issue because we do not have this problem with any other devices that we stream from.","

The streaming device we bought on Prime Day, with rewards, was practically free - but it's so bad that we can't even watch anything without it buffering. We gave up on it and returned to our old streaming device, which works fine. It's not our internet service that's the issue, since we don't have any of these problems with our other devices."
"I didn’t realize it needed an external power source in order to utilize the fire stick. I thought it was more along the lines of a flash drive device you Singley plugged into your tv. However, since using my amazon fire stick I have enjoyed every moment of it and would definitely recommend this product to any and all.","

I did not understand that the fire stick required an external power source in order to work. I assumed it was similar to a USB drive that you simply plugged into your TV. But since using the Amazon fire stick, I have been thoroughly enjoying it and would highly recommend it to anyone."

The product works well, though some of the applications may occasionally lag due to my internet connection. I really enjoy the voice control capabilities of Alexa."
"It does what it says it will do.  The picture quality is better than what I have been receiving on cable TV.  Only downside is if you pause the movie for more than a couple minutes it takes a long time to come back on and you often get a message that your internet speed is too slow (I'm clocking 300 mb at my house on a good day).  Also, voice command through Alexia doesn't work well, but that could be operator error.  All in all, for $20 you can't beat it.","

This product lives up to its promises; the image quality is far superior to what you get with cable TV. The only downside is that if you pause the movie for more than a few minutes, it takes an extended period to resume and you may receive a message that your internet speed is too low (I'm getting 300 mb on a good day). Additionally, the voice command functionality with Alexa may not be working perfectly, but that could be user error. All things considered, you can't beat it for the price of $20."
I loved everything," about the movie

I was enamored with the film in its entirety."

We were extremely let down when we had to do a mandatory upgrade and after we finished, we no longer had access to our local Charlotte NC channels (which included our news and weather from CBS, NBC, ABC). To add insult to injury, two days later was Amazon day with discounts on the items we had just bought."
Second one for my house. This is great...I am not tech oriented and all I have to do is hold down a button and talk. Now I am watching tv too much! LOL!,"

This is amazing - I'm not very tech savvy, but all I had to do was press a button and speak. Now I'm probably watching too much TV! Haha!"

Garbage...Even trying to watch Amazon Prime Video this piece of garbage looses internet connection half way thru a show. The cheapest Roku works 100 time better. DO not waste your time or money on this piece of garbage.,"

I am quite content with the convenience of operating my second Firestick."
I would not recommend this to anyone. It won't load netflix or if it does on rare occasion it won't run the program all the way thru. It tells you the we are unable to process this title at this time. Try again later.  It is not the Netflix site cause I can stream it just fine on my computer.  Its the Firestick. very disappointing.,"

I would not suggest this device to anyone. It often fails to load Netflix and if it does, it will not play the program to the end.

I really like that I can download all the apps for different media sources like HBO, Showtime, etc. that I have free access to from my cable account but with the Firestick I get a better picture and can go directly to the shows I want to see.

I have been a Chromecast user for a while and I can honestly say that the Firestick is a great improvement. I love that I have access to all of the same apps for streaming media like HBO and Showtime that I get through my cable subscription, but the Firestick gives me a much better picture quality and I can go right to the shows I want to watch. The only downside was that it took a while to download and configure all of the apps, but at least it is a one-time setup."

It appears to be functioning adequately, but no YouTube TV? That's hard to believe; they wouldn't prohibit an app that so many people are eager to use.

Same goes when I ask to play the radio. Also, many times it get confused when I ask to switch of &#34;the lights&#34;...as other items are also named the same, which is not true. Clearly no AI or natural language, very 'beta' stage still for me. Not impressed!","

I am very let down by this product. It appears to have a bug; when I request a newsflash or ask to play the radio, it often shuts down and reboots for a few minutes. Additionally, when I ask it to turn off ""the lights"", it often becomes confused as other items share the same name, which is not true.

I bought the echo dot while it was on sale for prime day and I was excited when it came in the next day. I set it up immediately and everything worked perfectly fine. The set up was easy and straight forward which I really appreciated because I am terrible with technology. The only reason why I am not satisfied with my purchase is because of the fact that I can't use the Echo Dot for more than 15 minutes without it disconnecting from the internet. I am connected to both 2.4GHZ and 5GHZ wifi links and neither works. It's very frustrating because I am not getting my use out of the Echo Dot and I really wish I could. If any one has had the same problems or has any solution please let me know!,"

"I had some trouble with my echo dot when I first got it because of internet connection issues. After doing research online I saw from some other people that they had trouble with the 2nd generation Echo Dot. However, the same weekend I took a trip and brought my Echo Dot along to the hotel where it seemed to work just fine. Now back home, the internet connection has seemed to have gotten through it's little rough patch and I haven't had any problems since. So, if you are having connection issues with an Echo Dot then it is probably the internet and not the device.","

However, when I took my Echo Dot on a trip to a hotel, it seemed to work fine. After I returned home, the internet connection seemed to have stabilized, and I haven't had any problems since.

Customer service couldn't help they basically told me to contact Sprint to assist.  So Echo does the bare minimum without access to my phone for set up, so its kind of pointless to have and pay for.","

I attempted to get Amazon to sync my phone number to the device, but it refused because it said the number was already in use. Customer service was unable to help me, and instead told me to get in touch with Sprint. As a result, my Echo is unable to do much without access to my phone, making it kind of a waste of money."

"What can I say. Well, I’m a  paranoid IT person of 30 years but got hooked on the idea of cloud based home control. So yes I love my echo stuff but, I did create a isolated VLAN on my home network to run the devices including the cheap ones that require you to sign up on some questionable website and download their app. Be carful with these people!  Entering your Wi-Fi password on a site that’s not vetted and your location when the app askes is not a good thing. Try to stay with devices that  work directly with the Alexa hub with no third-party app, Amazon has more control of these types of devices and how the  sensitive information is handled.","

I'm a paranoid IT person with 30 years experience, but I was drawn to the idea of cloud-based home control. I'm a fan of my Echo devices, but I set up a separate VLAN on my home network to run the cheaper ones that require you to register on a suspicious website and download their app. Be careful with these! Don't enter your Wi-Fi password on an untrustworthy site, or give your location when asked by the app. It's best to stick with devices that work directly with the Alexa hub, as Amazon has more control over how sensitive information is handled."

She is great for reading time, and timing 30 minutes for it.The only thing I really don't like, is that she HAS to be plugged in to an outlet to function. No ifs ands, or buts. I get why, but it is minorly inconvenient, as I have to move her from room to room, or purchase more. Lol","

I really love my dots! So awesome how it’s connects all my rooms. But like you’ve read with other reviews they are definitely lower in volume. Which I’m sure if I connected it to speaker or another device it would be great. But as a stand alone the volume is just ok. Definitely not like my tall echo. And the dots don’t pick up voice as good as my tall echo.Still totally love them and would recommend 100%,"

I'm absolutely in love with my dots! It's so cool how it can link all my rooms together. However, I've seen other reviews that mention the sound isn't as loud as I'd like. I'm sure if I connected it to a speaker or other device, the volume would be much better. On its own, it's just alright. It's definitely not as loud as my tall echo. Plus, the dots don't detect voice as well as my tall echo. Even with these drawbacks, I still adore my dots and would recommend them to anyone."

The daughter wanted a white boombox, but there wasn't anything suitable for an 11 year old.

"For the price, the product is nice quality and has a few nice features. So definitely no complaints there. The reason why I only gave it 3 stars is because the echo dot is not what I thought it was going to be so that may just be buyer error. First, I didn’t know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work. So I really don’t like that it’s not a stand alone device. Also, the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a Bluetooth speaker, don’t. Lastly, I’m sure the echo dot can do a lot but I haven’t quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own, plus setting it up was awful. I would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually “Alexa”.","

The product is of good quality and has some nice features for the price, so there are no complaints there. However, I only gave it 3 stars because it wasn't what I was expecting. I didn't know it had to be plugged in at all times to work, so I'm not a fan of that. Additionally, the speaker is not very loud, so it's not suitable as a Bluetooth speaker. I'm sure the echo dot can do a lot, but I haven't been able to figure out how to use it properly, and setting it up was a hassle. I'd recommend saving the money and buying the better one that is actually ""Alexa""."
"I love this product so far only because of the few things I can do with it...such as set a timer, a reminder, play music and games. I don't like that to get the full enjoyment from it that you have to purchase so many things. It was also very difficult to set up. The directions made it sound as simple as one, two, three but they forgot about step four, five and six. I was almost ready to send to back.The app is extremely slow and it took hours to get this thing set up. However depending on what you are going to be using it for I think it's an ok item.","

I have enjoyed some of the features of this product, such as setting a timer, a reminder, playing music and games. However, I do not like that you have to purchase so many extra items to get the full enjoyment out of it. Setting it up was also quite a challenge, as the instructions made it seem straightforward but they left out a few steps. I was almost ready to return it due to how slow the app is and how long it took me to get it set up. Nevertheless, depending on what you need it for, I think this product is acceptable."

Alexa is pretty basic and almost like a toy. Shouldn't have been released into the market without proper development. Speech recognition fails to understand basic American and British Accent.The music it can play is very restrictive. Speech isn't refined in a way that we understand a (almost a) human is speaking. Linking to Youtube via amazon web services doesn't work.,"

Alexa appears to be an unfinished product that was prematurely released to the market. Its speech recognition capabilities are not up to par, as it is unable to comprehend both American and British accents. The music selection is also very limited. Furthermore, the speech is not natural sounding, as if a human is speaking. Additionally, the integration with Youtube via Amazon Web Services is not functioning."

I am astonished by the alarm feature. I can ask Alexa to wake me up to a certain song and it does. I am pleased with the selection of music. I am unsure if I will still have access to the music if I do not keep Prime, but I was grateful for the three months of free music that Amazon provided. I think it would have been even better if they had given three months of Prime for free as well."

Then  I connected a speaker via the auxiliary jack. when i did that, the auxiliary jack picked up interference from the wifi and I was woken up in the middle of the night by a horrible buzzing sound. im hoping Amazon will take this thing back and give me a good deal on an echo spot which I hope will be a better nightstand device.","

I was thrilled with my first Echo, so I decided to get an Echo Dot for my bedroom. However, I was let down by the sound quality, so I connected an external speaker via Bluetooth. This improved the audio, but it caused issues with the WiFi connection, likely due to interference from the Bluetooth. I then tried connecting a speaker through the auxiliary jack, but the WiFi interference caused a horrible buzzing sound that woke me up in the middle of the night.

I mean, it's convenient, especially for those unable to reach to turn off lights or electronics that you could hook up to the Dot.

We are still experimenting with this voice activated device in our home, which is the first one we've ever tried. Even though it has some issues with our WiFi light bulbs, we've been able to work around it. It's definitely convenient, especially for anyone who can't physically reach to turn off lights or other electronics that can be connected to the Dot. I'm still getting used to the idea that it's always listening though. I do like that it can play music and set alarms and reminders."

I'm having a great time playing music, checking the weather, and asking questions like a king."
Small convenient and dependable. This dot is a cutie and Alexa does the job you ask.My only issue is the fidelity which is to be expected in a such a small speaker,"

This compact, reliable dot is a great device and Alexa does whatever you command it to do. The only downside is that the sound quality isn't very good, which is understandable given its size."
Alexa is perfect for people like me living alone. At least I have someone to talk to.. to keep my sanity. 😂 Though I wish it has a powerful speaker and no need to connect it to bluetooth speakers.,"

Alexa is ideal for people like me who live alone, providing me with someone to converse with and maintain my mental stability. It would be great if it had a powerful built-in speaker and didn't require a connection to external Bluetooth speakers."

This Dot speaker is a great value, even though it's not as powerful as the Alexa base. I'm using it in my guest bedroom for music, the clock, and getting information."
I had an Alexia built into my thermostat that just didn't work very well. I had to be standing right next to it for it to hear me and music played very choppy on it. I decided to try the Echo Dot since it was on Prime Day. I have not been disappointed! It hears me just fine and music plays with out any problem. I really like that I can Bluetooth connect to my Bose Speaker for quality sound.,"

My thermostat had an Alexia built into it, but it performed so poorly that I had to be right next to it for it to hear me and the music sounded distorted. On Prime Day, I decided to give the Echo Dot a try and I'm glad I did! It hears me from far away and plays music without any issues. Plus, I can easily connect it to my Bose Speaker via Bluetooth for better sound quality. I'm really happy with the Echo Dot."
I connected it to my whole home sound system to play prime music which my Google Home mini can't do.  It works well.,"

I hooked up my whole house audio system to play Amazon Prime Music, something my Google Home Mini can't do. It works great."
this is so much fun to play with - I just ask to set an alarm to wake in the morning and when it goes off I tell Alexa to turn it of - Alexa learns from the questions I ask. SHe will play music that you ask her to play if its the amazon music domain. If I wake up in the middle of the night I do not have to turn on a light I just ask alexa what time is it. When I want the current weather she tells me. Ask her what going on in the city she knows. Call a friend she will dial ( I haven't used that one yet but she said she could if its in y contacts.,"

Playing with Alexa is a blast - I just set an alarm to wake up in the morning and when it goes off, I can ask Alexa to turn it off. She learns from the questions I ask her, and she can play music from the Amazon Music domain if I request it. If I wake up in the middle of the night, I don't even have to turn on a light - I can just ask Alexa what time it is. She'll also tell me the current weather if I ask her. If I want to know what's happening in the city, she knows that too. And if I want to call a friend, she can dial them for me (although I haven't used that one yet, she said she could if they're in my contacts)."
Easy to set up and does everything it’s a poster. Despite its small size the speakers are adequate. Understands instructions from across the room. Very happy with the purchase.,"

Perfect for a home office,"

Weak sound. Compared to the Google Home Mini the sound is bad. Also you need Prime to have a small selection of music and need prime music to play everything. Also if you get two you need prime family music to play music on both. I think it's lame that you need a family plan to use multiple devices.,"

The sound quality of the Google Home Mini is much better than the weak sound of this device. You need a Prime subscription to access a limited selection of music, and if you have two devices, you need a Prime family plan to play music on both. It's not ideal that you need a family plan to use multiple devices."

So far, the experience has been positive. As I'm not very tech-savvy, I'm still trying to figure out what I can do with it, but it was easy to set up and has been easy to use. There are lots of apps that can be used with it, so I'll need to spend some more time exploring its capabilities, but I'm enjoying having it."

We have the Amazon music for her and now she can listen to music, check the weather, get phone numbers, make calls, etc., etc.. We are still learning but I tell you, this is absolutely amazing. I purchased 4 more for my extended family and the grandchildren absolutely love playing their music on Alexa. With the wifi and direct cable capability, the speaker/stereo options are there for the choosing. This is well worth the money. You won't regret this at all!","

I had delayed it for some time, but eventually I bought 3 of these for my house. My wife is blind and can't use the computer, so this was a true blessing. We have the Amazon music for her and now she can listen to tunes, get the temperature, find phone numbers, call people, and more. We are still learning, but it's unbelievable. I bought 4 more for my relatives and the grandchildren love using Alexa to play their music. With the wifi and direct cable options, you have a lot of speaker/stereo choices. This is a great investment and you won't be disappointed!"

Love it!,"

I'm really into it!"
I'm addicted to this thing.,"

I'm obsessed with this thing."
I love my Dot and am hoping to add a couple more around the apartment. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish the speaker would be just a little better. I know Amazon probably wanted to keep costs down for this item but I really like to play music around the apartment when I am busy doing things so if they would have added a speaker with just a little more wattage and bass response they would have something great to put in the bathroom or kitchen where there might not be a lot of space for a full sized Echo. I would have been willing to pay 10 to 20 dollars more if it had a better speaker. Oh well it is what it is and I still love it. I'm just going to have to find a Bluetooth speaker that sounds good but doesn't take up a whole lot of space.,"

I'm a fan of my Dot, but if it had a better speaker I would have given it five stars. I understand Amazon was trying to keep costs down, but I would have paid a bit extra for a speaker with more wattage and bass response. I'd like to be able to play music in smaller spaces like the bathroom and kitchen, so I'm now looking for a Bluetooth speaker that has good sound but doesn't take up too much room."
So far all.i can say is I love it,"

So far, my opinion is that I adore it."

"I'm obsessed with Alexa. She tells me the weather every morning, she can play games (we love the guess the song one!) and the one we have upstairs can turn off our TV downstairs which is so cool because why walk down the stairs if Alexa will do it for you????","

I am totally captivated by Alexa. Every morning, she informs me of the current weather conditions. We love playing the game ""Guess the Song"" with her. The Alexa upstairs is even capable of turning off the TV downstairs, which is incredibly convenient - why bother going downstairs to turn it off when Alexa can do it for you?"

Super easy to hook up and program. I use the music feature the most but I love how I can set reminders from my phone and my Echo will remind me at the set time. It’s great for my news updates too!,"

He’s a lot more calmer and doesn’t bark when we lock the door and start walking away. It’s a must have!","

I'm really glad that I can set Spotify as my default music source, since that's my favorite. Music is a constant in our home, and it helps keep our pup relaxed when we leave.

"I am quite disappointed by this product.There clearly is a bug: half of the time I ask for a newsflash, two second after it starts, the whole thing stops and reboots for a couple of minutes. Same goes when I ask to play the radio. Also, many times it get confused when I ask to switch of &#34;the lights&#34;...as other items are also named the same, which is not true. Clearly no AI or natural language, very 'beta' stage still for me. Not impressed!","

I am extremely dissatisfied with this product. It appears to have a bug where half the time I request a newsflash, the entire system shuts down and restarts for a few minutes immediately after it starts. The same happens when I ask it to play the radio. Additionally, it often gets confused when I ask it to switch off ""the lights"" since other items have the same name, which is not true. It does not seem to have any AI or natural language capabilities, and so it is still in an early stage of development. I am not pleased!"

"I have had the echo dot for about two weeks and am having fun with it. I set morning alarms, check the weather, have Alexa play various music (I bought inexpensive speakers to connect for better sound), and I'm learning her skills. A little tricky to connect to wifi initially, but after some trial and error it connected, and has stayed connected. So far, super satisfied. Will be buying one for my mother and one for my office.","

It's been two weeks since I got the Echo Dot and I'm already having a blast with it. I've set alarms for the mornings, asked Alexa about the weather, listened to music (I got some cheap speakers to get better sound), and I'm still discovering what she can do. It was a bit difficult to connect to the wifi at first, but after a few attempts it worked and hasn't disconnected since. I'm totally satisfied with it and I'm getting one for my mom and one for my office."

I am really enjoying my new Alexa. She is performing wonderfully."
I bought the echo dot while it was on sale for prime day and I was excited when it came in the next day. I set it up immediately and everything worked perfectly fine. The set up was easy and straight forward which I really appreciated because I am terrible with technology. The only reason why I am not satisfied with my purchase is because of the fact that I can't use the Echo Dot for more than 15 minutes without it disconnecting from the internet. I am connected to both 2.4GHZ and 5GHZ wifi links and neither works. It's very frustrating because I am not getting my use out of the Echo Dot and I really wish I could. If any one has had the same problems or has any solution please let me know!,"

I was ecstatic when I purchased the Echo Dot on Prime Day and it arrived the following day. I was able to set it up with ease, and it worked properly. Unfortunately, I am not content with my purchase because it disconnects from the internet after 15 minutes of use. I have both 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-Fi connections, but neither of them work. It's incredibly irritating that I can't get the most out of the Echo Dot. If anyone has experienced the same issue or has a solution, please let me know."
I got this for dad on father's Day!  He was tickled with it!,"

"I had some trouble with my echo dot when I first got it because of internet connection issues. After doing research online I saw from some other people that they had trouble with the 2nd generation Echo Dot. However, the same weekend I took a trip and brought my Echo Dot along to the hotel where it seemed to work just fine. Now back home, the internet connection has seemed to have gotten through it's little rough patch and I haven't had any problems since. So, if you are having connection issues with an Echo Dot then it is probably the internet and not the device.","

When I initially got my Echo Dot, I experienced some difficulties due to internet connection issues. After looking into it, I noticed that other people had similar issues with the second generation Echo Dot. However, when I took the Echo Dot on a trip to a hotel, it worked perfectly. After returning home, the internet connection seemed to be stable and I haven't had any further difficulties. Therefore, if you are having connection problems with an Echo Dot, it is likely due to the internet and not the device."
Small size works great in our sunroom.,"

The compact size is perfect for our sunroom."
I like it and it’s helful but it can only do certain thongs that is supported by amazon.,"

I appreciate it and find it useful, however, it is limited to the functions that Amazon supports."
"I reached out to Amazon, because the device wanted to sync my phone number but it would not allow because it said my number was already in use.  Customer service couldn't help they basically told me to contact Sprint to assist.  So Echo does the bare minimum without access to my phone for set up, so its kind of pointless to have and pay for.","

I attempted to connect my phone number with Amazon's device, however it was not possible since the system indicated the number was already in use. Customer service was unable to provide assistance, they merely suggested I speak to Sprint. As a result, the Echo was unable to complete the setup without access to my phone, making the device almost useless."
"It won’t work as a blue tooth speaker with my tv,it connects but won’t work","

My TV does not appear to be compatible with the blue tooth speaker; although the two devices are connected, the speaker does not function."

"This was an impulse buy but turns out I really enjoy my new dot. My grands love requesting songs and playing games.

I made an impulsive purchase, but it turns out I'm really glad I got my Echo Dot. My grandchildren love asking it to play songs and play games. I also enjoy listening to my Audible selections, keeping up with my tasks, and exploring new Alexa skills. It's both entertaining and useful, and I'm very pleased to have it in my home."

I like it alot. I connected it so I can play my Pandora and I asked about the weather & time every morning. I got rid of my old fashioned digitol clock because I can have my music play Unlimited on this. I'm going to ask it about vacations and a few other things once I get more comfortable with it. Definitely worth the money.,"

I'm very pleased with this purchase. I was able to set it up so I can listen to my Pandora music, and I can also ask it about the weather and time every morning. I got rid of my old digital clock because this allows me to listen to my music without any restrictions. I'm looking forward to further exploring its capabilities, such as asking it about vacations and other things. I think this was a great investment."
It plays music that I request.,"

It will perform the music that I ask for."
I didn't like that almost everytime i asked Alexa a question she would say i dont know that or i havent learned that.,"

I was frustrated that Alexa's response to almost every query I made was that she didn't know or hadn't learned it."
Luv it.  It's a great product.,"

I absolutely adore it. It is an excellent product."
"What can I say. Well, I’m a  paranoid IT person of 30 years but got hooked on the idea of cloud based home control. So yes I love my echo stuff but, I did create a isolated VLAN on my home network to run the devices including the cheap ones that require you to sign up on some questionable website and download their app. Be carful with these people!  Entering your Wi-Fi password on a site that’s not vetted and your location when the app askes is not a good thing. Try to stay with devices that  work directly with the Alexa hub with no third-party app, Amazon has more control of these types of devices and how the  sensitive information is handled.","

I'm an experienced IT person, so I'm naturally a bit paranoid, but I got interested in cloud-based home control. I love my Echo devices, but I made sure to set up a separate VLAN on my network for them and any other devices that require you to sign up on a website and download an app. Be careful with these kinds of sites; entering your Wi-Fi password and your location when the app asks is not a good idea. It's best to stick with devices that work directly with the Alexa hub, as Amazon has more control over how the sensitive information is handled."
Great product,"

This item is fantastic."
"Very helpful for playing music, setting alarms, and talking to you when you are lonely.","

This device is great for playing music, setting reminders, and providing companionship when you are feeling lonely."
"Easy to set up, can control Kasa smart plugs no problem.  Even the kids have figured stuff out that I would not have asked Alexa, like telling jokes and singing. The Alexa app controls my custom spark plug and my cloud cam.","

Setting up Kasa smart plugs is a breeze, and even kids have managed to get the hang of it. They've been able to ask Alexa to do things I wouldn't have thought of, such as telling jokes and singing. The Alexa app also makes it easy to control my custom spark plug and my cloud camera."
"I love having Alexa around the house. My favorite features are her timers, alarms, and music. Especially her library of sleep sounds. I got this product as a gift for my kids, and they love her too. She is great for reading time, and timing 30 minutes for it.The only thing I really don't like, is that she HAS to be plugged in to an outlet to function. No ifs ands, or buts. I get why, but it is minorly inconvenient, as I have to move her from room to room, or purchase more. Lol","

I thoroughly enjoy having Alexa in my home. I'm especially fond of her ability to set alarms, timers, and play music; the selection of sleep sounds is especially great. My children received this as a gift, and they are also big fans. She is perfect for reading time, and setting a timer for 30 minutes. The only downside is that she has to be plugged into an outlet to work; while I understand why, it can be a bit of a nuisance since I have to move her from room to room or buy more. Haha."

"My new best friend!! I'm a little behind the times I've never had anything like this, another alexa or google home, so to me this is a super amazing useful tool. I use it to play sleep sounds to sleep. I use it for my amazon audible books. Set alarms, reminders, receive notifications, play games with her. Have her tell me a short story lol. It's pretty fun. I know some people complained about the speaker I'm not sure why. I'm sure if you have an open concept house all to yourself and want to blast music no this might not blast it around loud enough. But I rent a room and in my bedroom it's perfect I don't have any problems with the speaker. Love everything about it!","

I'm thrilled to have a new best friend in the form of this amazing and useful tool! I'm a bit behind the times, so this is a first for me - I'm not used to having something like an Alexa or Google Home. I use it to play sleep sounds, listen to audiobooks on Amazon, set alarms and reminders, receive notifications, and even play games. It's really fun! Some people have complained about the speaker, but I think it's fine - it's perfect for my bedroom, and I don't have any issues with it. I'm really enjoying all aspects of it!"

I am fond of these devices; I have two Dots and an Echo. For a medium-sized room, they are loud enough without any additional speakers, although I do use external speakers with the Dots."
I really love my dots! So awesome how it’s connects all my rooms. But like you’ve read with other reviews they are definitely lower in volume. Which I’m sure if I connected it to speaker or another device it would be great. But as a stand alone the volume is just ok. Definitely not like my tall echo. And the dots don’t pick up voice as good as my tall echo.Still totally love them and would recommend 100%,"

I am really fond of my dots! It's amazing how it links all my rooms together. However, as other reviews have mentioned, the volume is quite low. I'm confident that if I connected it to a speaker or another device, the sound would be great. As a single unit, the volume is just okay. It's not as loud as my tall echo. Additionally, the dots don't pick up voices as well as my tall echo. Despite this, I still adore them and would highly recommend them."

"For the price, the product is nice quality and has a few nice features. So definitely no complaints there. The reason why I only gave it 3 stars is because the echo dot is not what I thought it was going to be so that may just be buyer error. First, I didn’t know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work. So I really don’t like that it’s not a stand alone device. Also, the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a Bluetooth speaker, don’t. Lastly, I’m sure the echo dot can do a lot but I haven’t quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own, plus setting it up was awful. I would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually “Alexa”.","

Considering the price, the product has good quality and some nice features. However, I only gave it 3 stars because it wasn't what I expected. I didn't realize it had to be plugged in at all times, the speaker isn't very loud, and I haven't figured out how to use it fully. Setting it up was also very difficult. I would suggest saving the money and buying the better model with Alexa."
"I love this product so far only because of the few things I can do with it...such as set a timer, a reminder, play music and games. I don't like that to get the full enjoyment from it that you have to purchase so many things. It was also very difficult to set up. The directions made it sound as simple as one, two, three but they forgot about step four, five and six. I was almost ready to send to back.The app is extremely slow and it took hours to get this thing set up. However depending on what you are going to be using it for I think it's an ok item.","

I'm quite fond of this product so far due to the various features it has, such as setting a timer, a reminder, listening to music and playing games. On the other hand, I'm not a huge fan of needing to buy extra things to get the full experience out of it. Setting it up was also a difficult process, as the instructions made it sound like a breeze, but they left out steps four, five and six. I almost decided to return it because of how slow the app was, and how long it took to get it up and running. Nevertheless, depending on what you're using it for, I think it's an acceptable item."

I enjoy listening to podcasts with this device, and I appreciate the morning greeting that informs me of any updates.

For approximately half a year, this device was connecting to the internet (wifi) without issue, but then suddenly stopped working. I attempted various fixes, but none of them worked. Customer service from Amazon was unable to offer any further assistance, and since the warranty was only 3 months, they were not willing to replace it, which was very disappointing."

In general, I enjoy this. Even though Siri on my phone is more useful for my needs since I don't have a ""smart home"" and don't plan on making one, it's still enjoyable and I use it to listen to music and have it read me my audiobooks."
Alexa is pretty basic and almost like a toy. Shouldn't have been released into the market without proper development. Speech recognition fails to understand basic American and British Accent.The music it can play is very restrictive. Speech isn't refined in a way that we understand a (almost a) human is speaking. Linking to Youtube via amazon web services doesn't work.,"

Alexa is quite rudimentary and almost like a plaything, which should not have been released for sale without proper refinement. Its speech recognition is unable to comprehend basic American and British accents. The music it can play is quite limited.

I'm amazed with the alarm. I tell Alexa to wake me up to a particular song and it does.  I love the play list if music. Not sure if i don't keep prime if music will still be available. However i did love the fact Amazon gave me music free for 3 months...they should have given prime free for 3 months as well.,"

I'm astonished by the alarm system. It's great that I can tell Alexa to wake me up to a certain song and it does. The selection of music is really impressive. I'm not sure if the music will still be available if I don't keep Prime, but I did appreciate that Amazon gave me free music for 3 months. It would have been even better if they had given us Prime for free for 3 months too."
I love all of the things that it can do. I can play with it and learn from it.,"

Then  I connected a speaker via the auxiliary jack. when i did that, the auxiliary jack picked up interference from the wifi and I was woken up in the middle of the night by a horrible buzzing sound. im hoping Amazon will take this thing back and give me a good deal on an echo spot which I hope will be a better nightstand device.","

Unfortunately, it sometimes gets our WiFi light bulbs mixed up and won't turn them on but we've been able to manage and fix it. I mean, it's convenient, especially for those unable to reach to turn off lights or electronics that you could hook up to the Dot. I do like that it plays music and has reminders, alarms, etc - I'm just still getting used to the fact that The Man is always listening now.","

Initially, I was very apprehensive about having a voice-activated device in our house, and this was our first time trying it out.

It is quite handy, especially for those who can't physically reach to turn off lights or other electronics that can be connected to it. I do like the fact that it can play music and set reminders and alarms, but I'm still adjusting to the idea that it's always listening."

Weak sound. Compared to the Google Home Mini the sound is bad. Also you need Prime to have a small selection of music and need prime music to play everything. Also if you get two you need prime family music to play music on both. I think it's lame that you need a family plan to use multiple devices.,"

The sound quality of the Google Home Mini is much better than this product. You need to have a Prime subscription to access a limited selection of music, and a Prime Family plan to play music on multiple devices.

I love my Dot and am hoping to add a couple more around the apartment. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish the speaker would be just a little better. I know Amazon probably wanted to keep costs down for this item but I really like to play music around the apartment when I am busy doing things so if they would have added a speaker with just a little more wattage and bass response they would have something great to put in the bathroom or kitchen where there might not be a lot of space for a full sized Echo. I would have been willing to pay 10 to 20 dollars more if it had a better speaker. Oh well it is what it is and I still love it. I'm just going to have to find a Bluetooth speaker that sounds good but doesn't take up a whole lot of space.,"

I'm a big fan of my Dot, and I'm looking to add a few more around my home. I gave it four stars because I wish the speaker was higher quality. Amazon probably wanted to keep the cost down, but I like to listen to music as I'm going about my day, so a better speaker with more wattage and bass response would have been worth paying a bit extra for. Since that's not an option, I'm going to have to find a Bluetooth speaker that sounds good and doesn't take up too much space."
So far all.i can say is I love it,"
